Summary: My more recent projects 

## Past and present projects at NASA include:

**SPHERES**  
Engineering management and lead support for SPHERES ISS research facility ([www.nasa.gov/spheres](www.nasa.gov/spheres))

**Tactical Flight Management Systems [(TFMS)]({static}/pdfs/TFMSconcept.pdf)**  
pilot-in-the-loop high fidelity 6-dof flight simulation, trajectory generation, optimization, and pilot display for tactical flight management systems (TFMS),

**Hypersonics Guidance & Control**  
controls-oriented vehicle design of air-breathing hypersonic aircraft,  
The research focus of the Hypersonics G&C project are:  
   - Development of models and associated control algorithms, analysis tools and design methodologies that permit the design of Highly Reliable Reusable Launch Systems (HRRLS) which offer robust dynamic performance in the presence of significant uncertainty by exploiting real-time measurements and available control actuators.  
   - Integration of control relevancy into the overall vehicle conceptualization, sizing, and design process. This will be done by incorporating control-relevant dynamical objectives (e.g. performance, robustness)
