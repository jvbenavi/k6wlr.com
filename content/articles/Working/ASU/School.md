Here's a selection of work done while in school at Arizona State University 

## University Research:

[**FPGA Analysis and Design of Embedded Processor Cores**]({attach}0_FPGAcore_Report5.pdf)  
This was a small paper I wrote for an undergraduate independant study class.

[**System Identification Tool**]({attach}FinalReport_SysId.pdf)  
This was my senior design project that utilized three networked Spartan-3 Starter Boards with two custom built boards to implement a Bench-top System ID tool using Rapid prototyping tools.

[**Low Cost Robotics Kit for Research**]({attach}FURI_poster.pdf)  
This was a Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative (FURI) poster project. It's an attempt to replace the robotics kit's currently used in undergraduate courses at a better price point with more features.

[**Design & Rapid Prototyping of Robust Fault-Tolerant Embedded control Systems Using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)**]({attach}Rapid_Poster_v2.pdf)  
This is my latest poster project that aims to better utilize rapid prototyping tools such as Xilinx System Generator for control system design.
