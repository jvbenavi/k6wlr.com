My first experience with a VPS has been interesting.

Objectives:  
- use a vps for hosting web pages, a reader, drop box, ... other things (initially Linode, now with DigitalOcean). At $10/mnt, (1GB) price is comparable to previous dreamhost.com web host provider  
- get setup with my own email domain (***@k6wlr.com). This was done with namecheap.com ($28/mnt)
namecheap also does registrations ...  

Setting up a LAMP + Wordpress server from scratch has been a learning experience and a fun weekend project.  

Useful [scripts]({attach}StackScript.txt) and [notes]({attach}wordpress.txt) for my self.
