Wow, these are cheap. [BaoFeng UV-5R](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JB2FOQS)

I just ordered two as my first ham radios. They may not have the nice features I really want like a TNC modem but they should be fun to get started with. And you can't beat the price. I look forward playing with them.
