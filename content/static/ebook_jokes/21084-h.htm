<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The ways of telling a story are as many as the tellers themselves. It is
impossible to lay down precise rules by which any one may perfect
himself in the art, but it is possible to offer suggestions by which to
guide practise in narration toward a gratifying success.</p>

<p>Broadly distinguished, there are two methods of telling a story. One
uses the extreme of brevity, and makes its chief reliance on the point.
The other devotes itself in great part to preliminary elaboration in the
narrative, making this as amusing as possible, so that the point itself
serves to cap a climax. In the public telling of an anecdote the tyro
would be well advised to follow the first method. That is, he should put
his reliance on the point of the story, and on this alone. He should
scrupulously limit himself to such statements as are absolutely
essential to clear understanding of the point. He should make a careful
examination of the story with two objects in mind: the first, to
determine just what is required in the way of explanation; the second,
an exact understanding of the point itself. Then, when it comes to the
relating of the story, he must simply give the information required by
the hearers in order to appreciate the point. As to the point itself, he
must guard against any carelessness. Omission of an essential detail is
fatal. It may be well for him, at the outset, to memorize the conclusion
of the story. No matter how falteringly the story is told, it will
succeed if the point itself be made clear, and this is insured for even
the most embarrassed speaker by memorizing it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p><p>The art of making the whole narration entertaining and amusing is to be
attained only by intelligent practise. It is commonly believed that
story-sellers are born, not made. As a matter of fact, however, the
skilled raconteurs owe their skill in great measure to the fact that
they are unwearying in practise. It is, therefore, recommended to any
one having ambition in this direction that he cultivate his ability by
exercising it. He should practise short and simple stories according to
his opportunities, with the object of making the narration smooth and
easy. An audience of one or two familiar friends is sufficient in the
earlier efforts. Afterward, the practise may be extended before a larger
number of listeners on social occasions. When facility has been attained
in the simplest form, attempts to extend the preliminary narrative
should be made. The preparation should include an effort to invest the
characters of the story; or its setting, with qualities amusing in
themselves, quite apart from any relation to the point. Precise
instruction cannot be given, but concentration along this line will of
itself develop the humorous perception of the story-teller, so that,
though the task may appear too difficult in prospect, it will not prove
so in actual experience. But, in every instance, care must be exercised
to keep the point of the story clearly in view, and to omit nothing
essential in the preparation for it.</p>

<p>In the selection of stories to be retailed, it is the part of wisdom to
choose the old, rather than the new. This is because the new story, so
called, travels with frightful velocity under modern social conditions,
and, in any particular case, the latest story, when told by you to a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>friend, has just been heard by him from some other victim of it. But
the memory of most persons for stories is very short. Practically never
does it last for years. So, it is uniformly safe to present as novelties
at the present day the humor of past decades. Moreover, the exercise of
some slight degree of ingenuity will serve to give those touches in the
way of change by which the story may be brought up to date. Indeed, by
such adaptation, the story is made really one's own&mdash;as the professional
humorists thankfully admit!</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Wit and humor, and the distinction between them, defy precise
definition. Luckily, they need none. To one asking what is beauty, a wit
replied: "That is the question of a blind man." Similarly, none requires
a definition of wit and humor unless he himself be lacking in all
appreciation of them, and, if he be so lacking, no amount of explanation
will avail to give him understanding. Borrow, in one of his sermons,
declared concerning wit: "It is, indeed, a thing so versatile,
multiform, appearing in so many shapes and garbs, so variously
apprehended of several eyes and judgments, that it seemeth no less hard
to settle a clear and certain notion thereof than to make a portrait of
Proteus, or to define the figure of the fleeting wind." Nor is it
fitting to attempt exact distinctions between wit and humor, which are
essentially two aspects of one thing. It is enough to realize that humor
is the product of nature rather than of art, while wit is the expression
of an intellectual art. Humor exerts an emotional appeal, produces
smiles or laughter; wit may be amusing, or it may not, according to the
circumstances, but it always provokes an intellectual appreciation.
Thus, Nero made a pun on the name of Seneca, when the philosopher was
brought before him for sentence. In speaking the decree that the old man
should kill himself, the emperor used merely the two Latin words: "Se
neca." We admit the ghastly cleverness of the jest, but we do not
chuckle over it.</p>

<p>The element of surprise is common to both wit and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> humor, and it is
often a sufficient cause for laughter in itself, irrespective of any
essentially amusing quality in the cause of the surprise. The
unfamiliar, for this reason, often has a ludicrous appeal to primitive
peoples. An African tribe, on being told by the missionary that the
world is round, roared with laughter for hours; it is told of a Mikado
that he burst a blood-vessel and died in a fit of merriment induced by
hearing that the American people ruled themselves. In like fashion, the
average person grins or guffaws at sight of a stranger in an outlandish
costume, although, as a matter of fact, the dress may be in every
respect superior to his own. Simply, its oddity somehow tickles the
risibilities. Such surprise is occasioned by contrasting circumstances.
When a pompous gentleman, marching magnificently, suddenly steps on a
banana peel, pirouettes, somersaults, and sits with extreme violence, we
laugh before asking if he broke a leg.</p>

<p>The fundamentals of wit and humor are the same throughout all the
various tribes of earth, throughout all the various ages of history. The
causes of amusement are essentially the same everywhere and always, and
only the setting changes according to time and place. But racial
characteristics establish preferences for certain aspects of fun-making,
and such preferences serve to some extent in differentiating the written
humor of the world along the lines of nationality. Nevertheless, it is a
fact that the really amusing story has an almost universal appeal. I
have seen in an American country newspaper a town correspondent's
humorous effort in which he gave Si Perkins's explanation of being in
jail. And that explanation ran on all fours with a Chinese<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> story ages
and ages old. The local correspondent did not plagiarize from the
Chinaman: merely, the humorous bent of the two was identical. In the
ancient Oriental tale, a man who wore the thief's collar as a punishment
was questioned by an acquaintance concerning the cause of his plight.</p>

<p>"Why, it was just nothing at all," the convict explained easily. "I was
strolling along the edge of the canal, when I happened to catch sight of
a bit of old rope. Of course, I knew that old piece of rope was of no
use to anyone, and so I just picked it up, and took it home with me."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," the acquaintance exclaimed. "Why should they
punish you so severely for a little thing like that? I don't understand
it."</p>

<p>"I don't understand it, either," the convict declared, "unless, maybe,
it was because there was an ox at the other end of the rope."</p>

<p>The universality of humor is excellently illustrated in Greek
literature, where is to be found many a joke at which we are laughing
to-day, as others have laughed through the centuries. Half a thousand
years before the Christian era, a platonic philosopher at Alexandria, by
name Hierocles, grouped twenty-one jests in a volume under the title,
"Asteia." Some of them are still current with us as typical Irish bulls.
Among these were accounts of the "Safety-first" enthusiast who
determined never to enter the water until he had learned to swim; of the
horse-owner, training his nag to live without eating, who was successful
in reducing the feed to a straw a day, and was about to cut this off
when the animal spoiled the test by dying untimely; of the fellow who
posed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>before a looking glass with his eyes closed, to learn how he
looked when asleep; of the inquisitive person who held a crow captive in
order to test for himself whether it would live two centuries; of the
man who demanded to know from an acquaintance met in the street whether
it was he or his twin brother who had just been buried. Another Greek
jest that has enjoyed a vogue throughout the world at large, and will
doubtless survive even prohibition, was the utterance of Diogenes, when
he was asked as to what sort of wine he preferred. His reply was: "That
of other people."</p>

<p>Again, we may find numerous duplicates of contemporary stories of our
own in the collection over which generations of Turks have laughed, the
tales of Nasir Eddin. In reference to these, it may be noted that
Turkish wit and humor are usually distinguished by a moralizing quality.
When a man came to Nasir Eddin for the loan of a rope, the request was
refused with the excuse that Nasir's only piece had been used to tie up
flour. "But it is impossible to tie up flour with a rope," was the
protest. Nasir Eddin answered: "I can tie up anything with a rope when I
do not wish to lend it."</p>

<p>When another would have borrowed his ass, Nasir replied that he had
already loaned the animal. Thereupon, the honest creature brayed from
the stable. "But the ass is there," the visitor cried indignantly. "I
hear it!" Nasir Eddin retorted indignantly: "What! Would you take the
word of an ass instead of mine?"</p>

<p>In considering the racial characteristics of humor, we should pay
tribute to the Spanish in the person of Cervantes, for <i>Don Quixote</i> is
a mine of drollery. But the bulk of the humor among all the Latin races
is of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> sort that our more prudish standards cannot approve. On the
other hand, German humor often displays a characteristic spirit of
investigation. Thus, the little boy watching the pupils of a girls'
school promenading two by two, graded according to age, with the
youngest first and the oldest last, inquired of his mother: "Mama, why
is it that the girls' legs grow shorter as they grow older?" In the way
of wit, an excellent illustration is afforded by Heine, who on receiving
a book from its author wrote in acknowledgment of the gift: "I shall
lose no time in reading it."</p>

<p>The French are admirable in both wit and humor, and the humor is usually
kindly, though the shafts of wit are often barbed. I remember a humorous
picture of a big man shaking a huge trombone in the face of a tiny
canary in its cage, while he roars in anger: "That's it! Just as I was
about, with the velvety tones of my instrument, to imitate the
twittering of little birds in the forest, you have to interrupt with
your infernal din!" The caustic quality of French wit is illustrated
plenteously by Voltaire. There is food for meditation in his utterance:
"Nothing is so disagreeable as to be obscurely hanged." He it was, too,
who sneered at England for having sixty religions and only one gravy. To
an adversary in argument who quoted the minor prophet Habakkuk, he
retorted contemptuously: "A person with a name like that is capable of
saying anything."</p>

<p>But French wit is by no means always of the cutting sort. Its more
amiable aspect is shown by the declaration of Brillat Savarin to the
effect that a dinner without cheese is like a beautiful woman with only
one eye. Often the wit is merely the measure of absurdity, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> when a
courtier in speaking of a fat friend said: "I found him sitting all
around the table by himself." And there is a ridiculous story of the
impecunious and notorious Marquis de Favi&egrave;res who visited a Parisian
named Barnard, and announced himself as follows:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I am about to astonish you greatly. I am the Marquis de
Favi&egrave;res. I do not know you, but I come to you to borrow five-hundred
luis."</p>

<p>Barnard answered with equal explicitness:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I am going to astonish you much more. I know you, and I am
going to lend them to you."</p>

<p>The amiable malice, to use a paradoxical phrase, which is often
characteristic of French tales, is capitally displayed in the following:</p>

<p>The wife of a villager in Poitou became ill, and presently fell into a
trance, which deceived even the physician, so that she was pronounced
dead, and duly prepared for burial. Following the local usage, the body
was wrapped in a sheet, to be borne to the burial place on the shoulders
of four men chosen from the neighborhood. The procession followed a
narrow path leading across the fields to the cemetery. At a turning, a
thorn tree stood so close that one of the thorns tore through the sheet
and lacerated the woman's flesh. The blood flowed from the wound, and
she suddenly aroused to consciousness. Fourteen years elapsed before the
good wife actually came to her deathbed. On this occasion, the
ceremonial was repeated. And now, as the bearers of the body approached
the turn of the path, the husband called to them:</p>

<p>"Look out for the thorn tree, friends!"</p>

<p>The written humor of the Dutch does not usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> make a very strong
appeal to us. They are inclined to be ponderous even in their play, and
lack in great measure the sarcasm and satire and the lighter subtlety in
fun-making. History records a controversy between Holland and Zealand,
which was argued pro and con during a period of years with great
earnestness. The subject for debate that so fascinated the Dutchmen was:
"Does the cod take the hook, or does the hook take the cod?"</p>

<p>Because British wit and humor often present themselves under aspects
somewhat different from those preferred by us, we belittle their efforts
unjustly. As a matter of fact, the British attainments in this direction
are the best in the world, next to our own. Moreover, in the British
colonies is to be found a spirit of humor that exactly parallels our own
in many distinctive features. Thus, there is a Canadian story that might
just as well have originated below the line, of an Irish girl, recently
imported, who visited her clergyman and inquired his fee for marrying.
He informed her that his charge was two dollars. A month later, the girl
visited the clergyman for the second time, and at once handed him two
dollars, with the crisp direction, "Go ahead and marry me."</p>

<p>"Where is the bridegroom?" the clergyman asked.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the girl, dismayed. "Don't you furnish him for the two
dollars?"</p>

<p>It would seem that humor is rather more enjoyable to the British taste
than wit, though there is, indeed, no lack of the latter. But the people
delight most in absurd situations that appeal to the risibilities
without any injury to the feelings of others. For example,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> Dickens
relates an anecdote concerning two men, who were about to be hanged at a
public execution. When they were already on the scaffold in preparation
for the supreme moment, a bull being led to market broke loose and ran
amuck through the great crowd assembled to witness the hanging. One of
the condemned men on the scaffold turned to his fellow, and remarked:</p>

<p>"I say, mate, it's a good thing we're not in that crowd."</p>

<p>In spite of the gruesome setting and the gory antics of the bull, the
story is amusing in a way quite harmless. Similarly, too, there is only
wholesome amusement in the woman's response to a vegetarian, who made
her a proposal of marriage. She did, not mince her words:</p>

<p>"Go along with you! What? Be flesh of your flesh, and you a-living on
cabbage? Go marry a grass widow!"</p>

<p>The kindly spirit of British humor is revealed even in sarcastic jesting
on the domestic relation, which, on the contrary, provokes the bitterest
jibes of the Latins. The shortest of jokes, and perhaps the most famous,
was in the single word of <i>Punch's</i> advice to those about to get
married:</p>

<p>"Don't!"</p>

<p>The like good nature is in the words of a woman who was taken to a
hospital in the East End of London. She had been shockingly beaten, and
the attending surgeon was moved to pity for her and indignation against
her assailant.</p>

<p>"Who did this?" he demanded. "Was it your husband?"</p>

<p>"Lor' bless yer, no!" she declared huffily. "W'y, my 'usband 'e 's more
like a friend nor a 'usband!"</p>

<p>Likewise, of the two men who had drunk not wisely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> but too well, with
the result that in the small hours they retired to rest in the gutter.
Presently, one of the pair lifted his voice in protest:</p>

<p>"I shay, le's go to nuzzer hotel&mdash;this leaksh!"</p>

<p>Or the incident of the tramp, who at the back door solicited alms of a
suspicious housewife. His nose was large and of a purple hue. The woman
stared at it with an accusing eye, and questioned bluntly:</p>

<p>"What makes your nose so red?"</p>

<p>The tramp answered with heavy sarcasm:</p>

<p>"That 'ere nose o' mine, mum, is a-blushin' with pride, 'cause it ain't
stuck into other folks's business."</p>

<p>But British wit, while often amiable enough, may on occasion be as
trenchant as any French sally. For example, we have the definition of
gratitude as given by Sir Robert Walpole&mdash;"A lively sense of future
favors." The Marquis of Salisbury once scored a clumsy partner at whist
by his answer to someone who asked how the game progressed: "I'm doing
as well as could be expected, considering that I have three
adversaries." So the retort of Lamb, when Coleridge said to him:
"Charles, did you ever hear me lecture?". * * * "I never heard you do
anything else." And again, Lamb mentioned in a letter how Wordsworth had
said that he did not see much difficulty in writing like Shakespeare, if
he had a mind to try it. "Clearly," Lamb continued, "nothing is wanted
but the mind." Then there is the famous quip that runs back to Tudor
times, although it has been attributed to various later celebrities,
including Doctor Johnson: A concert singer was executing a number lurid
with vocal pyrotechnics. An admirer <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>remarked that the piece was
tremendously difficult. This drew the retort from another auditor:</p>

<p>"Difficult! I wish to heaven it were impossible!"</p>

<p>Americans are famous, and sometimes infamous, for their devotion to the
grotesque in humor. Yet, a conspicuous example of such amusing absurdity
was given by Thackeray, who made reference to an oyster so large that it
took two men to swallow it whole.</p>

<p>It is undeniable that the British are fond of puns. It is usual to sneer
at the pun as the lowest form of wit. Such, alas! it too often is, and
frequently, as well, it is a form of no wit at all. But the pun may
contain a very high form of wit, and may please either for its
cleverness, or for its amusing quality, or for the combination of the
two. Naturally, the really excellent pun has always been in favor with
the wits of all countries. Johnson's saying, that a man who would make a
pun would pick a pocket, is not to be taken too seriously. It is not
recorded that Napier ever "pinched a leather," but he captured Scinde,
and in notifying the government at home of this victory he sent a
dispatch of one word, "<i>Peccavi</i>" ("I have sinned"). The pun is of the
sort that may be appreciated intellectually for its cleverness, while
not calculated to cause laughter. Of the really amusing kind are the
innumerable puns of Hood. He professed himself a man of many sorrows,
who had to be a lively Hood for a livelihood. His work abounds in an
ingenious and admirable mingling of wit and humor. For example:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>"Ben Battle was a soldier bold,</div>
<div class="i1">And used to war's alarms,</div>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><div>But a cannon ball took off his legs,</div>
<div class="i1">So he laid down his arms.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>"And as they took him off the field,</div>
<div class="i1">Cried he, 'Let others shoot,</div>
<div>'For here I leave my second leg,</div>
<div class="i1">'And the Forty-Second Foot.'"</div>
</div></div>

<p>It is doubtless true that it would require a surgical operation to get a
joke into some particular Scotchman's head. But we have some persons of
the sort even in our own country. Many of the British humorists have
been either Scotch or Irish, and it is rather profitless to attempt
distinctions as to the humorous sense of these as contrasted with the
English. Usually, stories of thrift and penuriousness are told of the
Scotch without doing them much injustice, while bulls are designated
Irish with sufficient reasonableness. In illustration of the Scotch
character, we may cite the story of the visitor to Aberdeen, who was
attacked by three footpads. He fought them desperately, and inflicted
severe injuries. When at last he had been subdued and searched the only
money found on him was a crooked sixpence. One of the thieves remarked
glumly:</p>

<p>"If he'd had a good shilling, he'd have killed the three of us."</p>

<p>And there is the classic from <i>Punch</i> of the Scotchman, who, on his
return home from a visit to London, in describing his experiences,
declared:</p>

<p>"I had na been there an hour when bang! went saxpence!"</p>

<p>Anent the Irish bull, we may quote an Irishman's answer when asked to
define a bull. He said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p><p>"If you see thirteen cows lying down in a field, and one of them is
standing up, that's a bull."</p>

<p>A celebrity to whom many Irish bulls have been accredited was Sir Boyle
Roche. He wrote in a letter:</p>

<p>"At this very moment, my dear&mdash;&mdash;, I am writing this with a sword in one
hand and a pistol in the other."</p>

<p>He it was who in addressing the Irish House of Commons asserted stoutly:</p>

<p>"Single misfortunes never come alone, and the greatest of all possible
misfortune is usually followed by a greater."</p>

<p>And there is the hospitable invitation of the Irishman:</p>

<p>"Sir, if you ever come within a mile of my house, I hope you will stop
there." And it was an Irishman who remarked to another concerning a
third: "You are thin, and I am thin, but he's as thin as the two of us
put together." Also, it was an Irishman who, on being overtaken by a
storm, remarked to his friend: "Sure, we'll get under a tree, and whin
it's wet through, faith, we'll get under another."</p>

<p>Naturally, we Americans have our own bulls a plenty, and they are by no
means all derived from our Irish stock. Yet, that same Irish stock
contributes largely and very snappily to our fund of humor. For the
matter of that, the composite character of our population multiplies the
varying phases of our fun. We draw for laughter on all the almost
countless racial elements that form our citizenry. And the whole content
of our wit and humor is made vital by the spirit of youth. The newness
of our land and nation gives zest to the pursuit of mirth. We ape the
old, but fashion its semblance to suit our livelier fancy. We moralize
in our jesting like the Turk,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> but are likely to veil the maxim under
the motley of a Yiddish dialect. Our humor may be as meditative as the
German at its best, but with a grotesque flavoring all our own. Thus,
the widow, in plaintive reminiscence concerning the dear departed, said
musingly:</p>

<p>"If John hadn't blowed into the muzzle of his gun, I guess he'd 'a' got
plenty of squirrels. It was such a good day for them!"</p>

<p>And in the moralizing vein, this:</p>

<p>The little girl had been very naughty. She was bidden by her mother to
make an addition to the accustomed bedtime prayer&mdash;a request that God
would make her a better girl. So, the dear child prayed: "And, O God,
please make Nellie a good little girl." And then, with pious
resignation, she added:</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, O God, Thy will, not mine, be done."</p>

<p>At times, we are as cynical as the French. So of the husband, who
confessed that at first after his marriage he doted on his bride to such
an extent that he wanted to eat her&mdash;later, he was sorry that he hadn't.</p>

<p>Our sophistication is such that this sort of thing amuses us, and, it is
produced only too abundantly. Luckily, in contrast to it, we have no
lack of that harmless jesting which is more typically English. For
example, the kindly old lady in the elevator questioned the attendant
brightly:</p>

<p>"Don't you get awful tired, sonny?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mum," the boy in uniform admitted.</p>

<p>"What makes you so tired, sonny? Is it the going up?'</p>

<p>"No, mum."</p>

<p>"Is it the going down?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p><p>"No, mum."</p>

<p>"Then what is it makes you so tired, sonny?"</p>

<p>"It's the questions, mum."</p>

<p>And this of the little boy, who was asked by his mother as to what he
would like to give his cousin for a birthday present.</p>

<p>"I know," was the reply, "but I ain't big enough."</p>

<p>Many of our humorists have maintained a constant geniality in their
humor, even in the treatment of distressing themes. For example, Josh
Billings made the announcement that one hornet, if it was feeling well,
could break up a whole camp meeting. Bill Nye, Artemas Ward and many
another American writer have given in profusion of amiable sillinesses
to make the nation laugh. It was one of these that told how a drafted
man sought exemption because he was a negro, a minister, over age, a
British subject, and an habitual drunkard.</p>

<p>The most distinctive flavor in American humor is that of the grotesque.
It is characteristic in Mark Twain's best work, and it is characteristic
of most of those others who have won fame as purveyors of laughter. The
American tourist brags of his own:</p>

<p>"Talk of Vesuve&mdash;huh! Niag'll put her out in three minutes." That
polished writer, Irving, did not hesitate to declare that Uncle Sam
believed the earth tipped when he went West. In the archives of our
government is a state paper wherein President Lincoln referred to
Mississippi gunboats with draught so light that they would float
wherever the ground was a little damp. Typically American in its
grotesquerie was the assertion of a rural humorist who asserted that the
hogs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> thereabout were so thin they had to have a knot tied in their
tails to prevent them from crawling through the chinks in the fence.</p>

<p>Ward displayed the like quality amusingly in his remark to the conductor
of a tediously slow-moving accommodation train in the South. From his
seat in the solitary passenger coach behind the long line of freight
cars, he addressed the official with great seriousness:</p>

<p>"I ask you, conductor, why don't you take the cow-catcher off the engine
and put it behind the car here? As it is now, there ain't a thing to
hinder a cow from strolling into a car and biting a passenger."</p>

<p>Similar extravagance appears in another story of a crawling train. The
conductor demanded a ticket from a baldheaded old man whose face was
mostly hidden in a great mass of white whiskers.</p>

<p>"I give it to ye," declared the ancient.</p>

<p>"I don't reckon so," the conductor answered. "Where did you get on?"</p>

<p>"At Perkins' Crossin'," he of the hoary beard replied.</p>

<p>The conductor shook his head emphatically.</p>

<p>"Wasn't anybody got aboard at Perkins' Crossin' 'cept one little boy."</p>

<p>"I," wheezed the aged man, "was that little boy."</p>

<p>In like fashion, we tell of a man so tall that he had to go up on a
ladder to shave himself&mdash;and down cellar to put his boots on.</p>

<p>We Americans are good-natured, as is necessary for humor, and we have
brains, as is necessary for wit, and we have the vitality that makes
creation easy, even inevitable. So there is never any dearth among us of
the spirit of laughter, of its multiform products that by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> their power
to amuse make life vastly more agreeable. Every newspaper, and most
magazines carry their quota of jests. Never, anywhere, was the good
story so universally popular as in America today. It is received with
gusto in the councils of government, in church, in club, in cross-roads
store. The teller of good stories is esteemed by all, a blessing
undisguised. The collection that follows in this volume is, it is
believed, of a sort that will help mightily to build an honorable fame
for the narrator.</p>

<p>For greater convenience in references to the volume, the various stories
and anecdotes are placed under headings arranged in alphabetical order.
The heading in every case indicates the subject to which the narration
may be directly applied. This will be found most useful in selecting
illustrations for addresses of any sort, or for use in arguments.
History tells us how Lincoln repeatedly carried conviction by expressing
his ideas through the medium of a story. His method is rendered
available for any one by this book.</p>

<h2>JOKES</h2>

<h3>FOR ALL OCCASIONS</h3>

<h3 class="left">ABSENTMINDEDNESS</h3>

<p>The man of the house finally took all the disabled umbrellas to the
repairer's. Next morning on his way to his office, when he got up to
leave the street car, he absentmindedly laid hold of the umbrella
belonging to a woman beside him, for he was in the habit of carrying
one. The woman cried "Stop thief!" rescued her umbrella and covered the
man with shame and confusion.</p>

<p>That same day, he stopped at the repairer's, and received all eight of
his umbrellas duly restored. As he entered a street car, with the
unwrapped umbrellas tucked under his arm, he was horrified to behold
glaring at him the lady of his morning adventure. Her voice came to him
charged with a withering scorn:</p>

<p>"Huh! Had a good day, didn't you!"</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The absentminded inventor perfected a parachute device. He was taken up
in a balloon to make a test of the apparatus. Arrived at a height of a
thousand feet, he climbed over the edge of the basket, and dropped out.
He had fallen two hundred yards when he remarked to himself, in a tone
of deep regret:</p>

<p>"Dear me! I've gone and forgotten my umbrella."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The professor, who was famous for the wool-gathering of his wits,
returned home, and had his ring at the door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> answered by a new maid. The
girl looked at him inquiringly:</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;ah&mdash;is Professor Johnson at home?" he asked, naming himself.</p>

<p>"No, sir," the maid replied, "but he is expected any moment now."</p>

<p>The professor turned away, the girl closed the door. Then the poor man
sat down on the steps to wait for himself.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The clergyman, absorbed in thinking out a sermon, rounded a turn in the
path and bumped into a cow. He swept off his hat with a flourish,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, madam."</p>

<p>Then he observed his error, and was greatly chagrined. Soon, however,
again engaged with thoughts of the sermon, he collided with a lady at
another bend of the path.</p>

<p>"Get out of the way, you brute!" he said.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The most absent-minded of clergymen was a Methodist minister who served
several churches each Sunday, riding from one to another on horseback.
One Sunday morning he went to the stable while still meditating on his
sermon and attempted to saddle the horse. After a long period of toil,
he aroused to the fact that he had put the saddle on himself, and had
spent a full half hour in vain efforts to climb on his own back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">ACQUAINTANCE</h3>

<p>The Scotchman who ran a livery was asked by a tourist as to how many the
carryall would hold.</p>

<p>"Fower generally," was the answer. "Likely sax, if they're weel
aquaint."</p>

<h3 class="left">ACTORS</h3>

<p>The tragedian had just signed a contract to tour South Africa. He told a
friend of it at the club. The friend shook his head dismally.</p>

<p>"The ostrich," he explained in a pitying tone, "lays an egg weighing
anywhere from two to four pounds."</p>

<h3 class="left">ADVERTISING</h3>

<p>The editor of the local paper was unable to secure advertising from one
of the business men of the town, who asserted stoutly that he himself
never read ads., and didn't believe anyone else did.</p>

<p>"Will you advertise if I can convince you that folks read the ads.?" the
editor asked.</p>

<p>"If you can show me!" was the sarcastic answer. "But you can't."</p>

<p>In the next issue of the paper, the editor ran a line of small type in
an obscure corner. It read:</p>

<p>"What is Jenkins going to do about it?"</p>

<p>The business man, Jenkins, hastened to seek out the editor next day. He
admitted that he was being pestered out of his wits by the curious. He
agreed to stand by the editor's explanation in the forthcoming issue,
and this was:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p><p>"Jenkins is going to advertise, of course."</p>

<p>Having once advertised, Jenkins advertises still.</p>

<h3 class="left">AFFECTION</h3>

<p>There are as many aspects of grief as there are persons to mourn. A
quality of pathetic and rather grisly humor is to be found in the
incident of an English laborer, whose little son died. The vicar on
calling to condole with the parents found the father pacing to and fro
in the living-room with the tiny body in his arms. As the clergyman
spoke phrases of sympathy, the father, with tears streaming down his
cheeks, interrupted loudly:</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, you don't know how I loved that li'll faller. Yus, sir, if it
worn't agin the law, I'd keep him, an' have him stuffed, that I would!"</p>

<h3 class="left">AGE</h3>

<p>The woman confessed to her crony:</p>

<p>"I'm growing old, and I know it. Nowadays, the policeman never takes me
by the arm when he escorts me through the traffic."</p>

<h3 class="left">ALIBI</h3>

<p>The mother called in vain for her young son. Then she searched the
ground floor, the first story, the second, and the attic&mdash;all in vain.
Finally, she climbed to the trap door in the roof, pushed it open, and
cried:</p>

<p>"John Henry, are you out there?"</p>

<p>An answer came clearly:</p>

<p>"No, mother. Have you looked in the cellar?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">AMNESTY</h3>

<p>The nurse at the front regarded the wounded soldier with a puzzled
frown.</p>

<p>"Your face is perfectly familiar to me," she said, musingly. "But I
can't quite place you somehow."</p>

<p>"Let bygones be bygones, mum," the soldier said weakly. "Yes, mum, I was
a policeman."</p>

<h3 class="left">ANATOMY</h3>

<p>The little boy, sent to the butcher shop, delivered himself of his
message in these words:</p>

<p>"Ma says to send her another ox-tail, please, an' ma says the last one
was very nice, an' ma says she wants another off the same ox!"</p>

<h3 class="left">APPEARANCE</h3>

<p>Little Willie came home in a sad state. He had a black eye and numerous
scratches and contusions, and his clothes were a sight. His mother was
horrified at the spectacle presented by her darling. There were tears in
her eyes as she addressed him rebukingly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Willie, Willie! How often have I told you not to play with that
naughty Peck boy!"</p>

<p>Little Willie regarded his mother with an expression of deepest disgust.</p>

<p>"Say, ma," he objected, "do I look as if I had been playing with
anybody?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The cross-eyed man at the ball bowed with courtly grace, and said:</p>

<p>"May I have the pleasure of this dance?"</p>

<p>Two wallflowers answered as with one voice:</p>

<p>"With pleasure."</p>

<h3 class="left">APPETITE</h3>

<p>The young man applied to the manager of the entertainment museum for
employment as a freak, and the following dialogue occurred:</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Enoch, the egg king."</p>

<p>"What is your specialty?"</p>

<p>"I eat three dozen hen's eggs, two dozen duck eggs, and one dozen goose
eggs, at a single setting."</p>

<p>"Do you know our program?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"We give four shows every day."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I understand that."</p>

<p>"And do you think you can do it?"</p>

<p>"I know I can."</p>

<p>"On Saturdays we give six shows."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"On holidays we usually give a performance every hour."</p>

<p>And now, at last, the young man showed signs of doubt.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p><p>"In that case, I must have one thing understood before I'd be willing to
sign a contract."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"No matter what the rush of business is in the show, you've got to give
me time to go to the hotel to eat my regular meals."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>Daniel Webster was the guest at dinner of a solicitous hostess who
insisted rather annoyingly that he was eating nothing at all, that he
had no appetite, that he was not making out a meal. Finally, Webster
wearied of her hospitable chatter, and addressed her in his most
ponderous senatorial manner:</p>

<p>"Madam, permit me to assure you that I sometimes eat more than at other
times, but never less."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>It was shortly after Thanksgiving Day that someone asked the little boy
to define the word appetite. His reply was prompt and enthusiastic:</p>

<p>"When you're eating you're 'appy; and when you get through you're
tight&mdash;that's appetite!"</p>

<h3 class="left">APPRECIATION</h3>

<p>The distinguished actor had a large photograph of Wordsworth prominently
displayed in his dressing-room. A friend regarded the picture with some
surprise, and remarked:</p>

<p>"I see you are an admirer of Wordsworth."</p>

<p>"Who's Wordsworth?" demanded the actor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p><p>"Why, that's his picture," was the answer, as the friend pointed.
"That's Wordsworth, the poet."</p>

<p>The actor regarded the photograph with a new interest.</p>

<p>"Is that old file a poet?" he exclaimed in astonishment. "I got him for
a study in wrinkles."</p>

<h3 class="left">ARGUMENT</h3>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," the old salt confided to the inquisitive lady, "I fell
over the side of the ship, and a shark he come along and grabbed me by
the leg."</p>

<p>"Merciful providence!" his hearer gasped. "And what did you do?"</p>

<p>"Let 'im 'ave the leg, o' course, ma'am. I never argues with sharks."</p>

<h3 class="left">ART</h3>

<p>An American tourist and his wife, after their return from abroad, were
telling of the wonders seen by them at the Louvre in Paris. The husband
mentioned with enthusiasm a picture which represented Adam and Eve and
the serpent in the Garden of Eden, in connection with the eating of the
forbidden fruit. The wife also waxed enthusiastic, and interjected a
remark:</p>

<p>"Yes, we found the picture most interesting, most interesting indeed,
because, you see, we know the anecdote."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The Yankee tourist described glowingly the statue of a beautiful woman
which he had seen in an art museum abroad.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p><p>"And the way she stood, so up and coming, was grand. But," he added,
with a tone of disgust, "those foreigners don't know how to spell. The
name of the statue was Posish'&mdash;and it was some posish, believe me! and
the dumb fools spelt it&mdash;'Psyche!'"</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>"Tell me, does your husband snore?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed&mdash;so delightfully."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Yes, really&mdash;he's so musical you know, his voice is baritone, he only
snores operatic bits, mostly <i>Aida</i>."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The packer from Chicago admired a picture by Rosa Bonheur.</p>

<p>"How much is that?" he demanded. The dealer quoted the price as $5,000.</p>

<p>"Holy pig's feet!" the magnate spluttered. "For that money, I can buy
live hogs and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His wife nudged him in the ribs, and whispered:</p>

<p>"Don't talk shop."</p>

<h3 class="left">ATHLETICS</h3>

<p>The sister spoke admiringly to the collegian who was calling on her
after field day, at which she had been present.</p>

<p>"And how they did applaud when you broke that record!"</p>

<p>Her little brother, who overheard, sniffed indignantly.</p>

<p>"Pa didn't applaud me for the one I broke," he complained. "He licked
me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">AUTHORS</h3>

<p>A woman lion-hunter entertained a dinner party of distinguished authors.
These discoursed largely during the meal, and bored one another and more
especially their host, who was not literary. To wake himself up, he
excused himself from the table with a vague murmur about opening a
window, and went out into the hall. He found the footman sound asleep in
a chair. He shook the fellow, and exclaimed angrily:</p>

<p>"Wake up! You've been listening at the keyhole."</p>

<h3 class="left">BABIES</h3>

<p>The visiting Englishman, with an eyeglass screwed to his eye, stared in
fascinated horror at the ugliest infant he had ever seen, which was in
its mother's arms opposite him in the street car. At last, his fixed
gaze attracted the mother's attention, then excited her indignation.</p>

<p>"Rubber!" she piped wrathfully.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" exclaimed the Englishman. "I fancied it might be real."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The teacher had explained to the class that the Indian women are called
squaws. Then she asked what name was given to the children?</p>

<p>"Porpoises," came one eager answer.</p>

<p>But a little girl whose father bred pigeons, called excitedly:</p>

<p>"Please, teacher, they're squabs!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">BAIT</h3>

<p>A gentleman strolling alongside a canal observed an old negro and a
colored boy fishing. A moment later, a splash was heard. The boy had
fallen into the water. The old darky, however, jumped in after the lad,
and succeeded in getting him safely to the bank. There he stood the
victim on his head to let the water drain out, and it was at this moment
that the gentleman arrived on the scene with profuse expressions of
admiration for the prompt rescue.</p>

<p>"It was noble of you," the gentleman declared rather rhetorically, "to
plunge into the water in that way at the risk of your life to save the
boy. I congratulate you on your brave display of heroic magnanimity."</p>

<p>The old colored man answered with an amiable grin:</p>

<p>"All right, boss. Ah doan know nuffin' 'bout magn'imity. But Ah jess had
to git dat boy out de water. He had de bait in his pocket."</p>

<h3 class="left">BALDNESS</h3>

<p>A patient complained to the doctor that his hair was coming out.</p>

<p>"Won't you give me something to keep it in?" he begged.</p>

<p>"Take this," the doctor said kindly, and he handed the patient a pill
box.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">BAPTISM</h3>

<p>On the way to the baptism, the baby somehow loosened the stopper of his
bottle, with the result that the milk made a frightful mess over the
christening robe. The mother was greatly shamed, but she was compelled
to hand over the child in its mussed garments to the clergyman at the
font.</p>

<p>"What name?" the clergyman whispered.</p>

<p>The agitated mother failed to understand, and thought that he complained
of the baby's condition. So she offered explanation in the words:</p>

<p>"Nozzle come off&mdash;nozzle come off!"</p>

<p>The clergyman, puzzled, repeated his whisper:</p>

<p>"What name?"</p>

<p>"Nozzle come off&mdash;nozzle come off!" The woman insisted, almost in tears.</p>

<p>The clergyman gave it up, and continued the rite:</p>

<p>"Nozzlecomeoff Smithers, I baptize thee in the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost."</p>

<h3 class="left">BAPTISTS</h3>

<p>The old colored man left the Methodist Church and joined the Baptist.
Soon afterward, he encountered his former pastor, who inquired the
reason for his change of sect. The old man explained fully.</p>

<p>"Fust off, I was 'Piscopal, but I hain't learned, an' they done say the
service so fast, I nebber could keep up, an' when I come out behin', dey
all look, an' I'se 'shamed. So I jined the Methodis'. Very fine church,
yes, suh. But dey done has 'Quiry meetin's. An', suh, us cullud folkses

<h3 class="left">BASEBALL</h3>

<p>The teacher directed the class to write a brief account of a baseball
game. All the pupils were busy during the allotted time, except one
little boy, who sat motionless, and wrote never a word. The teacher gave
him an additional five minutes, calling them off one by one. The fifth
minute had almost elapsed when the youngster awoke to life, and scrawled
a sentence. It ran thus:</p>

<p>"Rain&mdash;no game."</p>

<h3 class="left">BATTLE</h3>

<p><i>Teacher:</i> "In which of his battles was King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden
slain?"</p>

<p><i>Pupil:</i> "I'm pretty sure it was the last one."</p>

<h3 class="left">BEARS</h3>

<p>The old trapper was chased by a grizzly. When he had thrown away
everything he carried, and found, nevertheless, that the bear was
gaining rapidly, he determined to make a stand. As he came into a small
clearing, he faced about with his back to a stump, and got out and
opened his clasp-knife. The bear halted a rod away, and sat on its
haunches, surveying its victim gloatingly. The trapper, though not
usually given to praying, now improved the interval to offer a petition.</p>

<p>"O God," he said aloud, with his eyes on the bear, "if you're on my
side, let my knife git 'im quick in 'is vitals, an' if you're on 'is
side, let 'im finish me fust off. But, O God, if you're nootral, you
jist sit thar on that stump, an' you'll see the darndest bear fight you

<p>The guide introduced a tourist in the Rocky Mountains to an old hunter
who was reputed to have slain some hundreds of bears.</p>

<p>"This feller," the guide explained to the hunter, "would like to hear
about some of the narrer escapes you've had from bears."</p>

<p>The old mountaineer regarded the tourist with a disapproving stare.</p>

<p>"Young man," he said, "if there's been any narrer escapes, the bears had
'em."</p>

<h3 class="left">BEER</h3>

<p>The father of a school boy in New York City wrote to the boy's teacher a
letter of complaint. Possibly he welcomed the advent of
prohibition&mdash;possibly not! Anyhow, the letter was as follows:</p>

<p>"Sir: Will you please for the future give my boy some eesier somes to do
at nites. This is what he brought home to me three nites ago. If fore
gallins of bere will fill thirty to pint bottles, how many pint and half
bottles will nine gallins fill? Well, we tried and could make nothing of
it all, and my boy cried and said he wouldn't go back to school without
doing it. So, I had to go and buy a nine gallin' keg of bere, which I
could ill afford to do, and then we went and borrowed a lot of wine and
brandy bottles, beside a few we had by us. Well we emptied the keg into
the bottles, and there was nineteen, and my boy put that down for an
answer. I don't know whether it is rite or not, as we spilt some in
doing it.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Please let the next one be water as I am not able to buy any more
bere."</p>

<h3 class="left">BEGGARS</h3>

<p>The cultured maid servant announced to her mistress, wife of the
profiteer:</p>

<p>"If you please, ma'am, there's a mendicant at the door."</p>

<p>The mistress sniffed contemptuously:</p>

<p>"Tell 'im there's nothin' to mend."</p>

<h3 class="left">BEGINNERS</h3>

<p>A woman visitor to the city entered a taxicab. No sooner was the door
closed than the car leaped forward violently, and afterward went racing
wildly along the street, narrowly missing collision with innumerable
things. The passenger, naturally enough, was terrified. She thrust her
head through the open window of the door, and shouted at the chauffeur:</p>

<p>"Please, be careful, sir! I'm nervous. This is the first time I ever
rode in a taxi."</p>

<p>The driver yelled in reply, without turning his head:</p>

<p>"That's all right, ma'am. It's the first time I ever drove one!"</p>

<h3 class="left">BETROTHAL</h3>

<p>The cook, Nora, had announced her engagement to a frequenter at the
kitchen, named Mike. But a year passed and nothing was heard of the
nuptials. So, one day, the mistress inquired:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p><p>"When are you to be married, Nora?"</p>

<p>"Indade, an' it's niver at all, I'll be thinkin', mum," the cook
answered sadly.</p>

<p>"Really? Why, what is the trouble?"</p>

<p>The reply was explicit:</p>

<p>"'Tis this, mum. I won't marry Mike when he's drunk, an' he won't marry
me when he's sober."</p>

<p>The delinquent laggard swain had been telling of his ability as a
presiding officer. The girl questioned him:</p>

<p>"What is the parliamentary phrase when you wish to call for a vote?"</p>

<p>The answer was given with proud certainty:</p>

<p>"Are you ready for the question?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dearest," the girl confessed shyly. "Go ahead."</p>

<p>The man was weak and naturally unlucky, and so he got married three
times inside of a year. He was convicted and sentenced for four years.
He seemed greatly relieved. As the expiration of his term grew near, he
wrote from the penitentiary to his lawyer, with the plaintive query:</p>

<p>"Will it be safe for me to come out?"</p>

<h3 class="left">BIRTH</h3>

<p>The little girl in the zo&ouml;logical park tossed bits of a bun to the
stork, which gobbled them greedily, and bobbed its head toward her for
more.</p>

<p>"What kind of a bird is it, mamma?" the child asked.</p>

<p>The mother read the placard, and answered that it was a stork.</p>

<p>"O-o-o-h!" the little girl cried, as her eyes rounded. "Of course, it
recognized me!"</p>

<h3 class="left">BLESSING</h3>

<p>The philosopher, on being interrupted in his thoughts by the violent
cackling of a hen that had just laid an egg, was led to express his
appreciation of a kind Providence by which a fish while laying a million
eggs to a hen's one, does so in a perfectly quiet and ladylike manner.</p>

<h3 class="left">BLIND</h3>

<p>A shopkeeper with no conscience put by his door a box with a slit in the
cover and a label reading, "For the Blind." A month later, the box
disappeared. When some one inquired concerning it, the shopkeeper
chuckled, and pointed to the window.</p>

<p>"I collected enough," he explained. "There's the new blind."</p>

<h3 class="left">BLINDNESS</h3>

<p>The sympathetic and inquisitive old lady at the seashore was delighted
and thrilled by an old sailor's narrative of how he was washed overboard
during a gale and was only rescued after having sunk for the third time.</p>

<p>"And, of course," she commented brightly, "after you sank the third
time, your whole past life passed before your eyes."</p>

<p>"I presoom as how it did, mum," the sailor agreed. "But bein' as I had
my eyes shut, I missed it."</p>

<h3 class="left">BONE OF CONTENTION</h3>

<p>The crowd in the car was packed suffocatingly close. The timid passenger
thought of pickpockets, and thrust his hand into his pocket
protectingly. He was startled to encounter the fist of a fat
fellow-passenger.</p>

<p>"I caught you that time!" the fat man hissed.</p>

<p>"Thief yourself!" snorted the timid passenger. "Leggo!"</p>

<p>"Scoundrel!" shouted the fat man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p><p>"Help! Stop thief!" the little fellow spluttered, trying to wrench his
hand from the other's clasp. As the car halted, the tall man next the
two disputants spoke sharply:</p>

hands out of my pocket."</p>

<p>During the Civil War, an old negro was deeply interested in the
conflict, but showed no sign of wishing to take part in it. A white man
questioned him one day:</p>

<p>"The men of the North and South are killing one another on your account.
Why don't you pitch in and fight yourself?"</p>

<p>"Has you-all ever seen two dogs fightin' over a bone?" the negro
demanded.</p>

<p>"Many times, of course," was the answer.</p>

<p>The old negro chuckled as he said:</p>

<p>"Did you ever see de bone fight?"</p>

<p>"Well!&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"Dat's all! I'se de bone."</p>

<h3 class="left">BREAKFAST</h3>

<p>The Southern Colonel at Saratoga Springs, in the days before
prohibition, directed the colored waiter at his table in the hotel:</p>

<p>"You-all kin bring me a Kentucky breakfast."</p>

<p>"An' what is that, sir?" the waiter inquired doubtfully.</p>

<p>The Colonel explained:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p><p>"Bring me a big steak, a bulldog and a quart of Bourbon whiskey."</p>

<p>"But why do you order a bulldog?" asked the puzzled waiter.</p>

<p>"To eat the steak, suh!" snapped the Colonel.</p>

<h3 class="left">BREVITY</h3>

<p>The best illustration of the value of brief speech reckoned in dollars
was given by Mark Twain. His story was that when he had listened for
five minutes to the preacher telling of the heathen, he wept, and was
going to contribute fifty dollars, after ten minutes more of the sermon,
he reduced the amount of his prospective contribution to twenty-five
dollars, after half an hour more of eloquence, he cut the sum to five
dollars. At the end of an hour of oratory when the plate was passed, he
stole two dollars.</p>

<h3 class="left">BRIBERY</h3>

<p>A thriving baseball club is one of the features of a boy's organization
connected with a prominent church. The team was recently challenged by a
rival club. The pastor gave a special contribution of five dollars to
the captain, with the direction that the money should be used to buy
bats, balls, gloves, or anything else that might help to win the game.
On the day of the game, the pastor was somewhat surprised to observe
nothing new in the club's paraphernalia. He called the captain to him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p><p>"I don't see any new bats, or balls, or gloves," he said.</p>

<p>"We haven't anything like that," the captain admitted.</p>

<p>"But I gave you five dollars to buy them," the pastor exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," came the explanation, "you told us to spend it for
bats, or balls, or gloves, or anything that we thought might help to win
the game, so we gave it to the umpire."</p>

<h3 class="left">BRUTALITY</h3>

<p>Two ladies in a car disputed concerning the window, and at last called
the conductor as referee.</p>

<p>"If this window is open," one declared, "I shall catch cold, and will
probably die."</p>

<p>"If the window is shut," the other announced, "I shall certainly
suffocate." The two glared at each other.</p>

<p>The conductor was at a loss, but he welcomed the words of a man with a
red nose who sat near. These were:</p>

<p>"First, open the window, conductor. That will kill one. Next, shut it.
That will kill the other. Then we can have peace."</p>

<h3 class="left">BURGLARY</h3>

<p>A young couple that had received many valuable wedding presents
established their home in a suburb. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> morning they received in the
mail two tickets for a popular show in the city, with a single line:</p>

<p>"Guess who sent them."</p>

<p>The pair had much amusement in trying to identify the donor, but failed
in the effort. They duly attended the theatre, and had a delightful
time. On their return home late at night, still trying to guess the
identity of the unknown host, they found the house stripped of every
article of value. And on the bare table in the dining-room was a piece
of paper on which was written in the same hand as the enclosure with the
tickets:</p>

<p>"Now you know!"</p>

absent-mindedly:</p>

<p>"Yes, you certainly do."</p>

<p>"Oh, you horrid thing!" Jeanette gasped. "I'll never&mdash;never speak to you
again!"</p>

<p>In Bret Harte's <i>Mary McGillup</i>, there is a notable description of

<p>"'I have the honor of addressing the celebrated Rebel spy, Miss
McGillup?'" asked the vandal officer.</p>

<h3 class="left">CARDS</h3>

<p>A Tennessee farmer went to town and bought a gallon jug of whiskey. He
left it in the grocery store, and tagged it with a five of hearts from
the deck in his pocket, on which he wrote his name. When he returned two
hours later, the jug was gone. He demanded an explanation from the
grocer.</p>

<p>"Simple enough," was the reply. "Jim Slocum come along with a six of

<h3 class="left">CATS</h3>

<p>Clarence, aged eight, was a member of the Band of Mercy, of his Sunday
School, which was a miniature society for the prevention of cruelty to
animals. The badge was a small star, and Clarence wore this with as much
pride as ever a policeman had in his shield. He displayed eagerness in
the work, and grew somewhat unpopular with the other boys and girls by
reason of his many rebukes for their harsh treatment of animals. But one
morning his mother, on looking out of the window, observed to her horror
that the erstwhile virtuous Clarence had the family cat by the tail, and
was swinging it to and fro with every evidence of glee. In fact, it had
been the wailing of the outraged beast that had caused the mother to
look out.</p>

<p>"Why, Clarence!" she cried, aghast. "What are you doing to that poor
cat? And you a member of the Band of Mercy!"</p>

<p>Little Clarence released the cat, but he showed no shame as he
explained:</p>

<p>"I was&mdash;but I lost my star."</p>

<p>The teacher put a question to the class:</p>

<p>"What does a cat have that no other animal has?"</p>

<p>A number cried in unison:</p>

<p>"Fur!"</p>

<p>But an objector raised the point that bears and skunks have fur. One
pupil raised an eager hand:</p>

<p>"I know, teacher&mdash;whiskers!"</p>

<p>But another objector laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"Haw-haw! My papa has whiskers!"</p>

<p>The suggester of whiskers defended her idea by declaring: "My papa ain't
got whiskers."</p>

<p>"'Cause he can't!" the objector sneered. "Haw-haw! Your pa ain't no
good. My pa says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The teacher rapped for order, and repeated her question. A little girl
raised her hand, and at the teacher's nod spoke timidly.</p>

<p>"Kittens!"</p>

<p>The little girl returned from church deeply musing on the sermon, in
which the preacher had declared that animals, lacking souls, could not
go to heaven. As the result of her meditation, she presented a problem
to the family at the dinner table, when she asked earnestly:</p>

<p>"If cats don't go to heaven, where do the angels get the strings for
their harps?"</p>

<h3 class="left">CHARITY</h3>

<p>"Oh, mamma," questioned the child, "who's that?" He pointed to a nun who
was passing.</p>

<h3 class="left">CHICKEN-STEALING</h3>

<p>The Southern planter heard a commotion in his poultry house late at
night. With shot gun in hand, he made his way to the door, flung it open
and curtly ordered:</p>

<p>"Come out of there, you ornery thief!"</p>

<p>There was silence for a few seconds, except for the startled clucking of
the fowls. Then a heavy bass voice boomed out of the darkness:</p>

<p>"Please, Colonel, dey ain't nobody here 'cept jes' us chickens!"</p>

<h3 class="left">CHRISTIANITY</h3>

<p>A shipwrecked traveler was washed up on a small island. He was terrified
at thought of cannibals, and explored with the utmost stealth.
Discovering a thin wisp of smoke above the scrub, he crawled toward it
fearfully, in apprehension that it might be from the campfire of
savages. But as he came close, a voice rang out sharply:</p>

<p>"Why in hell did you play that card?" The castaway, already on his
knees, raised his hands in devout thanksgiving.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he exclaimed brokenly. "They are Christians!"</p>

<p>A political boss wished to show his appreciation of the services of a

darky for a Christmas present the choice between a ton of coal and a jug

snow, and wept bitterly.</p>

<h3 class="left">CHURCH</h3>

<p>The young members of the family had been taught to be punctilious in
contributing to the collection at church. One Sunday morning, when the
boxes were being passed, James, aged six, ran his eye over those in the
pew, and noticed that a guest of his sister had no coin in her hand.
"Where is your money?" he whispered. She answered that she hadn't any.
But James was equal to the emergency:</p>

<p>"Here, take mine," he directed. "That'll pay for you. I'll get under the
seat."</p>

<p>"That's the new waltz. My sister was raving about it. I think it's
pretty bad. I expect she danced it with somebody rather nice."</p>

<p>In former times, when royalties were more important, a lady at a court
ball was intensely gratified when a prince selected her as a partner.
She was almost overwhelmed with pride when he danced a second measure
with her.</p>

<p>"Oh," she gushed, as she reposed blissfully in his arms, "your highness
does me too great honor."</p>

<p>The prince answered coldly:</p>

<p>"But no, madam. Merely, my physician has directed me to perspire."</p>

<h3 class="left">CONCEALMENT</h3>

<p>The widow was deep in suds over the family wash, when she saw her pastor
coming up the path to the door. She gave directions to her young son to
answer the bell, and to tell the clergyman that his mother had just gone
down the street on an errand. Since the single ground floor room of the
cottage offered no better hiding place against observation from the
door, she crouched behind a clothes-horse hung with drying garments.
When the boy had opened the door to the minister, and had duly delivered
the message concerning his mother's absence, the reverend gentleman cast
a sharp look toward the screen of drying clothes, and addressed the boy
thus:</p>

<p>"Well, my lad, just tell your mother I called. And you might say to her
that the next time she goes down the street, she should take her feet
along."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">CONCEIT</h3>

<p>"I suppose I must admit that I do have my faults," the husband remarked
in a tone that was far from humble.</p>

<p>"Yes," the wife snapped, "and in your opinion your faults are better
than other folks' virtues."</p>

<h3 class="left">CONSCIENCE</h3>

<p>The child had been greatly impressed by her first experience in Sunday
school. She pressed her hands to her breast, and said solemnly to her
sister, two years older:</p>

<p>"When you hear something wite here, it is conscience whispering to you."</p>

<p>"It's no such thing," the sister jeered. "That's just wind on your
tummie."</p>

<h3 class="left">CONSTANCY</h3>

<p>His companion bent over the dying man, to catch the last faintly
whispered words. The utterance came with pitiful feebleness, yet with
sufficient clearness:</p>

<p>"I am dying&mdash;yes. Go to Fannie. Tell her&mdash;I died&mdash;with her name&mdash;on my
lips, that I&mdash;loved her&mdash;her alone&mdash;always ... And Jennie&mdash;tell
Jennie&mdash;the same thing."</p>

<h3 class="left">CONVERSION</h3>

<p>A zealous church member in a Kentucky village made an earnest effort to
convert a particularly vicious old mountaineer named Jim, who was
locally notorious for his godlessness. But the old man was hard-headed
and stubborn, firmly rooted in his evil courses, so that he resisted the
pious efforts in his behalf.</p>

<p>"Jim," the exhorter questioned sadly at last, "ain't you teched by the
story of the Lord what died to save yer soul?"</p>

<p>"Humph!" Jim retorted contemptuously. "Air ye aimin' to tell me the Lord
died to save me, when He ain't never seed me, ner knowed me?"</p>

<p>"Jim," the missionary explained with fervor, "it was a darn sight easier
for the Lord to die fer ye jest because He never seed ye than if He
knowed ye as well as we-alls do!"</p>

<h3 class="left">COOKERY</h3>

<p>The housewife gave the tramp a large piece of pie on condition that he
should saw some wood. The tramp retired to the woodshed, but presently
he reappeared at the back door of the house with the piece of pie still
intact save for one mouthful bitten from the end.</p>

<p>"Madam," he said respectfully to the wondering woman, "if it's all the
same to you, I'll eat the wood, and saw the pie."</p>

<h3 class="left">COURTESY</h3>

<p>The witness was obviously a rustic and quite new to the ways of a
court-room. So, the judge directed him:</p>

<p>"Speak to the jury, sir&mdash;the men sitting behind you on the benches."</p>

<p>The witness turned, bowed clumsily and said:</p>

<p>"Good-morning, gentlemen."</p>

<h3 class="left">COWARDICE</h3>

<p>The old farmer and his wife visited the menagerie. When they halted
before the hippopotamus cage, he remarked admiringly:</p>

<p>"Darn'd curi's fish, ain't it, ma?"</p>

<p>"That ain't a fish," the wife announced. "That's a rep-tile."</p>

<p>It was thus that the argument began. It progressed to a point of such
violence that the old lady began belaboring the husband with her
umbrella. The old man dodged and ran, with the wife in pursuit. The
trainer had just opened the door of the lions' cage, and the farmer
popped in. He crowded in behind the largest lion and peered over its
shoulder fearfully at his wife, who, on the other side of the bars,
shook her umbrella furiously.</p>

<p>"Coward!" she shouted. "Coward!"</p>

<h3 class="left">CURIOSITY</h3>

<p>The colored man, passing through the market, saw a turtle for the first
time, and surveyed it with great interest. The creature's head was
withdrawn, but as the investigator fumbled about the shell, it shot
forward and nipped his finger. With a howl of pain he stuck his finger
in his mouth, and sucked it.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" the fishmonger asked with a grin.</p>

<p>"Nothin'&mdash;jest nothin' a tall," the colored man answered thickly. "Ah
was only wonderin' whether Ah had been bit or stung."</p>

<h3 class="left">DAMAGES</h3>

<p>The child came to his mother in tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, mama," he confessed, "I broke a tile in the hearth."</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear," the mother consoled. "But how ever did you come to
do it?"</p>

<p>"I was pounding it with father's watch?"</p>

<h3 class="left">DANGER</h3>

<h3 class="left">DEAD CERTAINTY</h3>

<p>On Tuesday, a colored maid asked her mistress for permission to be
absent on the coming Friday. She <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>explained that she wished to attend
the funeral of her fianc&eacute;. The mistress gave the required permission
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"But you're not wearing mourning, Jenny," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, ma'am," the girl replied. "You see, ma'am, he ain't dead yet.
The hanging ain't till Friday."</p>

<h3 class="left">DEAD MEN'S SHOES</h3>

<p>When a certain officer of the governor's staff died, there were many
applicants for the post, and some were indecently impatient. While the
dead colonel was awaiting burial, one aspirant buttonholed the governor,
asking:</p>

<p>"Would you object to my taking the place of the colonel?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," the governor replied tartly. "See the undertaker."</p>

<h3 class="left">DEAFNESS</h3>

<p>In the smoking-room of a theatre, between the acts, an amiable young man
addressed an elderly gentleman who was seated beside him:</p>

<p>"The show is very good, don't you think?"</p>

<p>The old gentleman nodded approvingly, as he replied:</p>

<p>"Me, I always take the surface cars. Them elevated an' subway stairs
ketches my breath."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p><p>"I said the show was a good one," exclaimed the young man, raising his
voice.</p>

<p>Again, the elderly person nodded agreeably.</p>

<p>"They jump about a good deal," was his comment, "but they're on the
ground, which the others ain't."</p>

<p>Now, the young man shouted:</p>

<p>"You're a little deaf, ain't you?"</p>

<p>At last the other understood.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" he announced proudly. "I'm as deef as a post." He chuckled
contentedly. "Some folks thinks as that's a terrible affliction, but I
don't. I kin always hear what I'm sayin' myself, an' that's interestin'
enough for me."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>An excellent old gentleman grew hard of hearing, and was beset with
apprehension lest he become totally deaf. One day, as he rested on a
park bench, another elderly citizen seated himself alongside. The
apprehensive old gentleman saw that the new comer was talking rapidly,
but his ears caught no faintest sound of the other's voice. He listened
intently&mdash;in vain. He cupped a hand to his ear, but there was only
silence. At last, in despair, he spoke his thought aloud:</p>

<p>"It's come at last! I know you've been talking all this while, but I
haven't heard a single word."</p>

<p>The answer, given with a grin, was explicit and satisfying to the
worried deaf man:</p>

<p>"I hain't been talkin'&mdash;jest a-chewin'."</p>

<h3 class="left">DEDICATION</h3>

<p>The visitor to the poet's wife expressed her surprise that the man of
genius had failed to dedicate any one of his volumes to the said wife.
Whereupon, said wife became flustered, and declared tartly:</p>

<p>"I never thought of that. As soon as you are gone, I'll look through all
his books, and if that's so, I never will forgive him!"</p>

<p>The schoolboy, after profound thought, wrote this definition of the word

<p>Phil May, the artist, when once down on his luck in Australia, took a
job as waiter in a very low-class restaurant. An acquaintance came into
the place to dine, and was aghast when he discovered the artist in his
waiter.</p>

<p>"My God!" he whispered. "To find you in such a place as this."</p>

<p>Phil May smiled, as he retorted:</p>

<p>"Oh, but, you see, I don't eat here."</p>

<h3 class="left">DELAY</h3>

<p>A woman in the mountains of Tennessee was seated in the doorway of the
cabin, busily eating some pig's feet. A neighbor hurried up to tell of
how her husband had become engaged in a saloon brawl and had been shot
to death. The widow continued munching on a pig's foot in silence while
she listened to the harrowing news. As the narrator paused, she spoke
thickly from her crowded mouth:</p>

<p>"Jest wait till I finish this-here pig's trotter, an' ye'll hear some
hollerin' as is hollerin'."</p>

<h3 class="left">DEVIL</h3>

<p>Some wasps built their nests during the week in a Scotch clergyman's
best breeches. On the Sabbath as he warmed up to his preaching, the
wasps, too, warmed up, with the result that presently the minister was
leaping about like a jack in the box, and slapping his lower anatomy
with great vigor, to the amazement of the congregation.</p>

<p>"Be calm, brethren," he shouted. "The word of God is in my mouth, but
the De'il's in my breeches!"</p>

<h3 class="left">DIET</h3>

<p>The young lady, who was something of a food fadist, was on a visit to a
coast fishing village. She questioned her host as to the general diet of
the natives, and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> told that they subsisted almost entirely on fish.
The girl protested:</p>

<p>"But fish is a brain food, and these folks are really the most
unintelligent-looking that I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Mebbe so," the host agreed. "And just think what they'd look like if
they didn't eat fish!"</p>

<h3 class="left">DIGESTION</h3>

<p>In an English school, the examiner asked one of the children to name the
products of the Indian Empire. The child was well prepared, but very
nervous.</p>

<p>"Please, sir," the answer ran, "India produces curries and pepper and
rice and citron and chutney and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Then, as the first child remained silent, a
little girl raised her hand. The examiner nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may name any other products of India."</p>

<p>"Please, sir," the child announced proudly, "India-gestion."</p>

<p>"Now, let me see," the impecunious man demanded as he buttonholed an
acquaintance, "do I owe you anything?"</p>

paying your little debts?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm going about to see if I've overlooked anybody? Lend me ten till

<p>Ted had a habit of dropping in at the house next door on baking day, for
the woman of that house had a deft way in the making of cookies, and Ted
had no hesitation in enjoying her hospitality, even to the extent of
asking for cookies if they were not promptly forthcoming.</p>

<p>When the boy's father learned of this, he gave Ted a lecture and a
strict order never to ask for cookies at the neighbor's kitchen. So,
when a few days later the father saw his son munching a cookie as he
came away from the next house, he spoke sternly:</p>

<p>"Have you been begging cookies again?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I didn't beg any," Ted answered cheerfully. "I just said, this

<h3 class="left">DISCRETION</h3>

<p>The kindly and inquisitive old gentleman was interested in the messenger
boy who sat on the steps of a house, and toyed delicately with a

The puzzled observer questioned the lad:</p>

<p>"Now, sonny, why don't you eat your sandwich right down, instead of

<p>In a former generation, when elaborate doctrines were deemed more
important by Christian clergymen than they are to-day, they were prone
to apply every utterance of the Bible to the demonstration of their own
particular tenets. For example, one distinguished minister announced his
text and introduced his sermon as follows:</p>

<p>"'So, Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem, for he did eat at the King's
table, and he was lame on both his feet.'</p>

<p>"My brethren, we are here taught the doctrine of human
depravity.&mdash;Mephibosheth was lame. Also the doctrine of total
depravity&mdash;he was lame on both his feet. Also the doctrine of
justification&mdash;for he dwelt in Jerusalem. Fourth, the doctrine of
adoption&mdash;'he did eat at the King's table.' Fifth, the doctrine of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>

<p>"How Fido would have enjoyed these bones!"</p>

<p>The young clergyman during a parochial call noticed that the little
daughter of the hostess was busy with her slate while eying him closely
from time to time.</p>

<p>"And what are you doing, Clara?" he asked, with his most engaging smile.</p>

<p>"I'm drawing a picture of you," was the answer.</p>

<p>The clerical visitor sat very still to facilitate the work of the
artist. But, presently, Clara shook her head in discouragement.</p>

<p>"I don't like it much," she confessed. "I guess I'll put a tail on it,
and call it a dog."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The meditative Hollander delivered a monologue to his dog:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p><p>"You vas only a dog, but I vish I vas you. Ven you go your bed in, you

<p>Some persons are born to have honor thrust upon them, and such is
obviously the case of the actor named in this story.</p>

<p>The colored maid of an actress took out for exercise her mistress's dog,
a splendid St. Bernard. A passer-by admired the animal, and inquired as
to the breed. The maid said:</p>

<p>"I doan jes' zactly know mahself, but I dun hear my missis say he am a
full-blood Sam Bernard."</p>

<h3 class="left">DOMESTIC QUARRELS</h3>

<p>After a trip abroad, a lady inquired of her colored washerwoman:</p>

<p>"Lucy, do you and your husband quarrel now the same as you used to?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p><p>"No, indeed, ma'am," was the reply.</p>

<p>"That is good. I'm sure you're very glad of it, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Ah sho'ly is."</p>

<p>"What caused you to stop quarreling, Lucy?" the lady asked.</p>

<p>The explanation was simple and sufficient:</p>

<p>"He died."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The newly married pair quarreled seriously, so that the wife in a
passion finally declared:</p>

<p>"I'm going home to my mother!"</p>

<p>The husband maintained his calm in the face of this calamity, and drew
out his pocketbook.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, counting out some bills, "is the money for your
railroad fare."</p>

<p>The wife took it, and counted it in her turn. Then she faced her husband
scornfully:</p>

<p>"But that isn't enough for a return ticket."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The good wife, after she and her husband had retired for the night,
discoursed for a long time with much eloquence. When she was interrupted
by a snore from her spouse, she thumped the sleeper into wakefulness,
and then remarked:</p>

<p>"John, do you know what I think of a man who will go to sleep while his
own wife is a-talkin' to him?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, I believe as how I do, Martha," was the drowsily uttered
response. "But don't let that stop you. Go right ahead, an' git it off
your mind."</p>

<h3 class="left">DOUBT</h3>

<p>Small Jimmie discussed with his chief crony the minister's sermon which
had dealt with the sheep and the goats.</p>

and father calls me kid."</p>

<p>Ability to look on two sides of a question is usually a virtue, but it
may degenerate into a vice. Thus, a visitor found his bachelor friend
glumly studying an evening waistcoat. When inquiry was made, this
explanation was forthcoming:</p>

<p>"It's quite too soiled to wear, but really, it's not dirty enough to go
to the laundry. I can't make up my mind just what I should do about it."</p>

<h3 class="left">DRAMA</h3>

<p>The new play was a failure. After the first act, many left the theatre;
at the end of the second, most of the others started out. A cynical
critic as he rose from his aisle seat raised a restraining hand.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he commanded loudly. "Women and children first!"</p>

<h3 class="left">DREAMS</h3>

<p>The group of dwellers at the seaside was discussing the subject of
dreams and their significance. During a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> pause, one of the party turned
to a little girl who had sat listening intently, and asked:</p>

<p>"Do you believe that dreams come true?"</p>

<p>"Of course, they do," the child replied firmly. "Last night I dreamed
that I went paddling&mdash;and I had!"</p>

<h3 class="left">DRESS</h3>

<p>"Oh, have you heard? Mrs. Blaunt died to-day while trying on a new
dress."</p>

<p>"How sad! What was it trimmed with?"</p>

<p>The son of the house had been reading of an escaped lunatic.</p>

<p>"How do they catch lunatics?" he asked.</p>

<p>The father, who had just paid a number of bills, waxed sarcastic:</p>

<p>"With enormous straw hats, with little bits of ones, with silks and
laces and feathers and jewelry, and so on and so on."</p>

<p>"I recall now," the mother spoke up, "I used to wear things of that sort
until I married you."</p>

<h3 class="left">DRINK</h3>

<p>It was nine o'clock in the morning, but this particular passenger on the
platform of the trolley car still wore a much crumpled evening suit.</p>

<p>As the car swung swiftly around a curve this riotous liver was jolted
off, and fell heavily on the cobble stones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> The car stopped, and the
conductor, running back, helped the unfortunate man to scramble to his
feet. The bibulous passenger was severely shaken, but very dignified.</p>

<p>"Collision?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"No," the conductor answered.</p>

<p>"Off the track?" was the second inquiry.</p>

<p>"No," said the conductor again.</p>

<p>"Well!" was the indignant rejoinder. "If I'd known that, I wouldn't have
got off."</p>

<p>The very convivial gentleman left his club happy, but somewhat dazed. On
his homeward journey, made tackingly, he ran against the vertical iron
rods that formed a circle of protection for the trunk of a tree growing
by the curb. He made a tour around the barrier four times, carefully
holding to one rod until he had a firm grasp on the next. Then, at last,
he halted and leaned despairingly against the rock to which he held, and
called aloud for succor:</p>

<p>"Hellup! hellup! Somebody let me out!"</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The highly inebriated individual halted before a solitary tree, and
regarded it as intently as he could, with the result that he saw two
trees. His attempt to pass between these resulted in a near-concussion
of the brain. He reeled back, but presently sighted carefully, and tried
again, with the like result. When this had happened a half-dozen times,
the unhappy man lifted up his voice and wept.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p><p>"Lost&mdash;Lost!" he sobbed. "Hopelessly lost in an impenetrable forest!"</p>

<p>The proprietor of the general store at the cross-roads had his place
overrun by rats, and the damage was such that he offered a hundred
dollars reward to anyone who would rid him of the pests. A
disreputable-appearing person turned up one morning, and announced that
he was a professional rat-killer.</p>

<p>"Get to work," the store-keeper urged.</p>

<p>"I must have a pound of cheese," the killer declared.</p>

<p>When this had been provided:</p>

<p>"Now give me a quart of whiskey."</p>

<p>Equipped with the whiskey, the professional spoke briskly:</p>

<p>"Now show me the cellar."</p>

<p>An hour elapsed, and then the rat-catcher galloped up the cellar stairs
and leaped into the store. His face was red, the eyes glaring, and he
shook his fists in defiance of the world at large, as he jumped high in
air and shouted:</p>

<p>"Whoopee! I'm ready! bring on your rats!"</p>

<p>The colonel left nothing doubtful in the nature of his reply:</p>

<p>A mouse chanced on a pool of whiskey that was the result of a raid by
prohibition-enforcement agents. The mouse had had no previous
acquaintance with liquor, but now, being thirsty, it took a sip of the
strange fluid, and then retired into its hole to think. After some
thought, it returned to the pool, and took a second sip of the whiskey.
It then withdrew again to its hole, and thought. Presently, it issued
and drew near the pool for the third time. Now, it took a big drink. Nor
did it retreat to its hole. Instead, it climbed on a soap box, stood on
its hind legs, bristled its whiskers, and squeaked:</p>

<p>"Now, bring on your cat!"</p>

<p>"How long does it take you to carry your produce to market by muleback?"</p>

<p>"Three days, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Then," said the engineer, "you can understand the benefit the road will
be to you. You will be able to take your produce to market, and to
return home on the same day."</p>

<p>"Very good, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>," the native agreed courteously.</p>

<p>"But, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>, what shall we do with the other two days?"</p>

<h3 class="left">EXCLUSIVENESS</h3>

<p>One of the New York churches is notorious for its exclusiveness. A
colored man took a fancy to the church, and promptly told the minister
that he wished to join. The clergyman sought to evade the issue by
suggesting to the man that he reflect more carefully on the matter, and
make it the subject of prayers for guidance. The following day, the
darky encountered the minister.</p>

<p>"Ah done prayed, sah," he declared, beaming, "an' de Lawd he done sent
me an answer las' night."</p>

<p>"And what was it?" queried the clergyman, somewhat at a loss. "What did

another job.</p>

<p>"But how'll I get down?" Pat demanded.</p>

<p>Mike, on the pavement, suggested jumping as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> only means. Pat's lunch
was below, he was hungry, and he accepted the suggestion seriously.</p>

<p>"Will yez kitch me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Sure, an' I'll do that," Mike agreed.</p>

<p>Pat clapped his arms in imitation of a rooster, and crowed, to bolster
up his courage, and leaped. He regained consciousness after a short
interval, and feebly sat up on the pavement. He regarded Mike
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"For why did yez not kitch me?" he asked, and the pain in bones sounded
in his voice.</p>

<p>"Begorry," Mike replied sympathetically, "I was waiting for yez to
bounce!"</p>

<h3 class="left">EXPENSE ACCOUNT</h3>

<p>The woman wrote a reference for her discharged cook as follows:</p>

<p>"Maggie Flynn has been employed by me for a month. She is an excellent
cook, but I could not afford to make use of her services longer."</p>

<p>The husband, who was present, afterward expressed his surprise at the
final clause.</p>

<p>"But it's true," the wife answered. "The dishes she smashed cost double
her wages."</p>

<h3 class="left">EXPERIENCE</h3>

<p>The baby pulled brother's hair until he yelled from the pain of it. The
mother soothed the weeping boy:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p><p>"Of course, she doesn't know how badly it hurts." Then she left the
room.</p>

<p>She hurried back presently on hearing frantic squalling from baby.</p>

<p>"What in the world is the matter with her?" she questioned anxiously.</p>

<p>"Nothin' 'tall," brother replied contentedly. "Only now she knows."</p>

<h3 class="left">EXPERTS</h3>

<p>There was a chicken-stealing case before the court. The colored culprit
pleaded guilty and was duly sentenced. But the circumstances of the case
had provoked the curiosity of the judge, so that he questioned the darky
as to how he had managed to take those chickens and carry them off from
right under the window of the owner's house, and that with a savage dog
loose in the yard. But the thief was not minded to explain. He said:</p>

<p>"Hit wouldn't be of no use, jedge, to try to 'splain dis ting to
you-all. Ef you was to try it you more'n like as not would git yer hide
full o' shot an' git no chickens, nuther. Ef you want to engage in any
rascality, jedge, you better stick to de bench, whar you am familiar."</p>

<h3 class="left">EXPLICITNESS</h3>

<p>On her return home after an absence of a few hours, the mother was
displeased to find that little Emma, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> was ailing, had not taken her
pill at the appointed time, although she had been carefully directed to
do so.</p>

<p>"You were very naughty, Emma," the mother chided. "I told you to be sure
and take that pill."</p>

<p>"But, mamma," the child pleaded in extenuation, "you didn't tell me
where to take it to."</p>

<h3 class="left">EXTRAVAGANCE</h3>

<p>A rich and listless lady patron examined the handbags in a leading
jeweler's shop in New York City. The clerk exhibited one bag five inches
square, made of platinum and with one side almost covered with a setting
of diamonds. This was offered at a price of $9,000.</p>

<p>But the lady surveyed the expensive bauble without enthusiasm. She
turned it from side to side and over and over, regarding it with a
critical eye and frowning disapprovingly. At last she voiced her
comment:</p>

<p>"Rather pretty, but I don't like this side without diamonds. Honestly,
the thing looks skimpy&mdash;decidedly skimpy!"</p>

<p>For $7,000 additional, the objectional skimpiness was corrected.</p>

<h3 class="left">FACTS</h3>

<p>The burly man spoke lucidly to his gangling adversary:</p>

<p>"You're a nincompoop, a liar and hoss-thief."</p>

<p>The other man protested, with a whine in his voice:</p>

<p>"Sech talk ain't nice&mdash;and, anyhow, 'tain't fair twittin' on facts."</p>

<h3 class="left">FASHION</h3>

<p>After years of endeavor in poverty, the inventor made a success, and
came running home with pockets bulging real money. He joyously strewed
thousand-dollar bills in his wife's lap, crying:</p>

<p>"Now, at last, my dear, you will be able to buy you some decent
clothes."</p>

<p>"I'll do nothing of the kind," was the sharp retort. "I'll get the same
kind the other women are wearing."</p>

<h3 class="left">FIGHTING</h3>

<p>The boy hurried home to his father with an announcement:</p>

<p>"Me and Joe Peck had a fight to-day."</p>

<p>The father nodded gravely.</p>

<p>The little boy's face brightened.</p>

<p>"Gee, pop! I hope you made out 's well 's I did!"</p>

<h3 class="left">FINANCE</h3>

<p>A very black little girl made her way into the presence of the lady of
the house, and with much embarrassment, but very clearly, explained who
she was, and what her mission:</p>

<p>"Please, mum, I'se Ophelia. I'se de washerwoman's little girl, an' mama,
she sent me to say, would you please to len' her a dime. She got to pay
some bills."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The successful financier snorted contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Money! pooh! there are a million ways of making money."</p>

<p>"But only one honest way," a listener declared.</p>

<p>"What way is that?" the financier demanded.</p>

<p>"Naturally, you wouldn't know," was the answer.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The eminent financier was discoursing.</p>

<p>"The true secret of success," he said, "is to find out what the people
want."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p><p>"And the next thing," someone suggested, "is to give it to them."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The eminent banker explained just how he started in business:</p>

<p>"I had nothing to do, and I rented an empty store, and put up a sign,
<i>Bank</i>. As soon as I opened for business, a man dropped in, and made a
deposit of two hundred dollars. The next day another man dropped in and
deposited three hundred dollars. And so, sir, the third day, my
confidence in the enterprise reached such a point that I put in fifty
dollars of my own money."</p>

<h3 class="left">FINANCIERS</h3>

<p>"My pa, he's a financier," boasted one small boy to another.</p>

<p>"'Tain't much to brag of," the other sneered. "My pa an' uncle Jack are

<h3 class="left">FISHING</h3>

<p>The congressman from California was telling at dinner in the hotel of
tuna fishing.</p>

<p>"Just run out in a small motor boat," he explained, "and anything less
than a hundred pounds is poor sport."</p>

<p>The colored waiter was so excited that he interrupted:</p>

<p>"You say you go after hundred-pound fish in a little motor boat, suh?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p><p>The congressman nodded.</p>

<p>"But," the darky protested, "ain't you scairt fer fear you'll ketch

<h3 class="left">FLATTERY</h3>

<p>An eminent statesman was being driven rapidly by his chauffeur, when the
car struck and killed a dog that leaped in front of it. At the
statesman's order, the chauffeur stopped the car, and the great man got
out and hurried back to where a woman was standing by the remains. The
dead dog's mistress was deeply grieved, and more deeply angered. As the
statesman attempted to address her placatingly, she turned on him
wrathfully, and told him just what she thought, which was considerable
and by no means agreeable. When, at last, she paused for breath, the
culprit tried again to soothe her, saying:</p>

<p>"Madam, I shall be glad to replace your dog."</p>

<p>The woman drew herself up haughtily, surveyed the statesman with supreme
scorn, and hissed:</p>

<p>"Sir, you flatter yourself!"</p>

<h3 class="left">FLEAS</h3>

<p>The debutante was alarmed over the prospect of being taken in to dinner
by the distinguished statesman.</p>

<p>"Whatever can we talk about?" she demanded anxiously of her mother.</p>

<p>Afterward, in the drawing-room, she came to her mother with a radiant
smile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p><p>"He's fine," she exclaimed. "We weren't half way through the soup before
we were chatting cozily about the fleas in Italian hotels."</p>

<h3 class="left">FLIRTATION</h3>

<p>The gentleman at the party, who was old enough to know better, turned to
another guest, who had just paused beside him:</p>

<p>"Women are fickle. See that pretty woman by the window? She was smiling
at me flirtatiously a few minutes ago and now she looks cold as an
iceberg."</p>

<p>"I have only just arrived," the other man said. "She is my wife."</p>

<h3 class="left">FLOOD</h3>

<p>The breakfaster in the cheap restaurant tried to make conversation with
the man beside him at the counter.</p>

<p>"Awful rainy spell&mdash;like the flood."</p>

<p>"The flood?" The tone was polite, but inquiring.</p>

<p>"<i>The</i> flood&mdash;Noah, the Ark, Mount Ararat."</p>

<p>The other bit off half a slice of bread, shook his head, and mumbled
thickly:</p>

<p>"Hain't read to-day's paper yit."</p>

Nevertheless, a Welsh newspaper of recent date carried the following
paragraph:</p>

<p>"At &mdash;&mdash; Church, on Monday last, a very interesting wedding was
solemnized, the contracting parties being Mr. Richard &mdash;&mdash;, eldest son
of Mr. and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, and a bouquet of pink carnations."</p>

<p>The old gentleman was lost in a London fog, so thick that he could
hardly see his hand before his face. He became seriously alarmed when he
found himself in a slimy alley. Then he heard footsteps approaching
through the obscurity, and sighed with relief.</p>

<p>"Where am I going to?" he cried anxiously.</p>

<p>A voice replied weirdly from the darkness beyond:</p>

<p>"Into the river&mdash;I've just come out!"</p>

<h3 class="left">FOLLIES</h3>

<p>A wise old Quaker woman once said that men were guilty of three most
astonishing follies. The first was the climbing of trees to shake down
the fruit, when if they would but wait, the fruit would fall of itself.
The second was the going to war to kill one another, when if they would
only wait, they must surely die naturally. The third was that they
should run after women, when, if they did not do so, the women would
surely run after them.</p>

<p>The Arctic explorer at a reception on his return gave an informal talk
concerning his experiences. He explained that a point further north
would have been reached, if the dogs had not given out at a critical
time.</p>

<p>A lady, who had followed the explorer's remarks carefully, ventured a
comment as the speaker paused:</p>

<p>"But I thought those Esquimaux dogs were actually tireless."</p>

<p>The explorer hesitated, and cleared his throat before answering.</p>

<p>"I spoke," he elucidated, "in a&mdash;er&mdash;culinary sense."</p>

<p>The master directed that the picture should be hung on the east wall;
the mistress preferred the west wall.</p>

<h3 class="left">FORGETFULNESS</h3>

<p>The foreman of a Southern mill, who was much troubled by the
shiftlessness of his colored workers, called sharply to two of the men
slouching past him.</p>

<p>"Hi, you! where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Well, suh, boss," one of them answered, "we is goin' to de mill wid
dis-heah plank."</p>

<p>"Plank? What plank? Where's the plank?" the foreman demanded.</p>

<p>The colored spokesman looked inquiringly and somewhat surprisedly at his
own empty hands and those of his companion, whom he addressed
good-naturedly:</p>

<p>"Now, if dat don't beat all, George! If we hain't gone an' clean

<p>Two men met on the city street in the evening, and had a number of
drinks together. The one who lived in the suburbs became confidential,
and exhibited a string tied around a finger.</p>

<p>"I don't dare to go home," he explained. "There's something my wife told
me to do, without fail, and to make sure I wouldn't forget, she tied
that string around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> my finger. But for the life of me I can't remember
what the thing was I am to do. And I don't dare to go home!"</p>

<p>A few days later the two men met again, this time in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Well," the one asked, "did you finally remember what that string was to
remind you of?"</p>

<p>The other showed great gloom in his expression, as he replied:</p>

<p>"I didn't go home until the next night, just because I was scared, and
then my wife told me what the string was for all right&mdash;she certainly
did!" There was a note of pain in his voice. "The string was to remind

<p>The clergyman drew near to the baptismal font, and directed that the

<h3 class="left">FORM</h3>

<p>The traveler wrote an indignant letter to the officials of the railroad
company, giving full details as to why he had sat up in the smoking-room
all night, instead of sleeping in his berth. He received in reply a
letter from the company, which was so courteous and logical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> that he was
greatly soothed. His mood changed for the worse, however, when he
happened to glance at his own letter, which had been enclosed through
error. On the margin was jotted in pencil:</p>

<h3 class="left">FRAUD</h3>

<p>The hired man on a New England farm went on his first trip to the city.
He returned wearing a scarf pin set with at least four carats bulk of
radiance. The jewelry dazzled the rural belles, and excited the envy of
the other young men. His employer bluntly asked if it was a real

miserable and lonely indeed.</p>

<h3 class="left">FRENCH</h3>

<p>An American tourist in France found that he had a two hours' wait for
his train at a junction, and set out to explore the neighborhood. He
discovered at last that he was lost, and could not find his way back to
the station. He therefore addressed a passer-by in the best French he
could recollect from his college days, mispronouncing it with great
emphasis. He voiced his request for information as follows:</p>

<p>"Pardonnez-moi. J'ai quitt&eacute; ma train et maintenant je ne sais pas o&ugrave; le

<h3 class="left">FUSSINESS</h3>

<p>The traveler in the Blue Ridge Mountains made his toilet as best he
could with the aid of the hand basin on its bench by the cabin door and
the roller towel. He made use of his own comb and brush, tooth-brush,
nail-file and whiskbroom. The small son of the cabin regarded his
operations with rounded eyes, and at last broke forth:</p>

<p>"By cricky, mister, I wantta know! Be ye allus thet much trouble to

<h3 class="left">GENDER</h3>

<p>It is quite possible to trap clergymen, as well as laymen, with the
following question, because they are not always learned in the Old
Testament.</p>

<p>"If David was the father of Solomon, and Joab was the son of Zeruiah,
what relation was Zeruiah to Joab?"</p>

<p>Most persons give the answer that Zeruiah was the father of Joab,
necessarily. That is not the correct answer. The trouble is that Zeruiah
was a woman. And, of course, David and Solomon having nothing whatever
to do with the case.</p>

<h3 class="left">GENTLEMAN</h3>

<p>There has been much controversy for years as to the proper definition of
the much abused word "gentleman." Finally, by a printer's error in
prefixing <i>un</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> to an adverb, an old and rather mushy description of a
gentleman has been given a novel twist and a pithy point. A
contributor's letter to a metropolitan daily appeared as follows:</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;I can recall no better description of a gentleman than this&mdash;</p>

<p>"'A gentleman is one who never gives offense unintentionally.'"</p>

<h3 class="left">GEOGRAPHY</h3>

<p>The airman, after many hours of thick weather, had lost his bearings
completely. Then it cleared and he was able to make a landing.
Naturally, he was anxious to know in what part of the world he had
arrived. He put the question to the group of rustics that had promptly
assembled. The answer was explicit:</p>

<p>"You've come down in Deacon Peck's north medder lot."</p>

<h3 class="left">GHOSTS</h3>

<p>There was a haunted house down South which was carefully avoided by all
the superstitious negroes. But a new arrival in the community, named
Sam, bragged of his bravery as too superior to be shaken by any ghosts,
and declared that, for the small sum of two dollars cash in hand paid,
he would pass the night alone in the haunted house. A score of other
darkies contributed, and the required amount was raised. It was not,
however, to be delivered to the courageous Sam until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> his reappearance
after the vigil. With this understanding the boaster betook himself to
the haunted house for the night.</p>

<p>When a select committee sought for Sam next morning, no trace of him was
found. Careful search for three days failed to discover the missing
negro.</p>

<p>But on the fourth day Sam entered the village street, covered with mud
and evidently worn with fatigue.</p>

<p>"Hi, dar, nigger!" one of the bystanders shouted. "Whar you-all been de
las' foh days?"</p>

<p>And Sam answered simply:</p>

<p>"Ah's been comin' back."</p>

<p>The little boy was found by his mother with pencil and paper, making a
sketch. When asked what he was doing, he answered promptly, and with
considerable pride:</p>

<p>"I'm drawing a picture of God."</p>

<p>"But," gasped the shocked mother, "you cannot do that. No one has seen
God. No one knows how God looks."</p>

<p>"Well," the little boy replied, complacently, "when I get through they
will."</p>

<h3 class="left">GOD'S WILL</h3>

<p>The clergyman was calling, when the youthful son and heir approached his
mother proudly, and exhibited a dead rat. As she shrank in repugnance,
he attempted to reassure her:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p><p>"Oh, it's dead all right, mama. We beat it and beat it and beat it, and
it's deader 'n dead."</p>

<p>His eyes fell on the clergyman, and he felt that something more was due
to that reverend presence. So he continued in a tone of solemnity:</p>

<p>"Yes, we beat it and beat it until&mdash;until God called it home!"</p>

<h3 class="left">GOLF</h3>

<p>The eminent English Statesman Arbuthnot-Joyce plays golf so badly that
he prefers a solitary round with only the caddy present. He had a new
boy one day recently, and played as wretchedly as usual.</p>

<p>"I fancy I play the worst game in the world," he confessed to the caddy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't say that, sir," was the consoling response. "From what
the boys were saying about another gentleman who plays here, he must be
worse even than you are."</p>

<p>"What's his name?" asked the statesman hopefully.</p>

<p>And the caddy replied:</p>

<p>The son and heir had just been confirmed. At the dinner table, following
the church service, the father called on his son to say grace. The boy
was greatly embarrassed by the demand. Moreover, he was tired, not only
from the excitement of the special service<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> through which he had passed,
but also from walking to and from the church, four miles away, and, too,
he was very hungry indeed and impatient to begin the meal. Despite his
protest, however, the father insisted.</p>

<p>So, at last, the little man folded his hands with a pious air, closed
his eyes tight, bent his head reverently, and spoke his prayer:</p>

<p>"O Lord, have mercy on these victuals. Amen!"</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The new clergyman in the country parish, during his visit to an old lady
of his flock, inquired if she accepted the doctrine of Falling from
Grace. The good woman nodded vigorously.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she declared with pious zeal, "I believe in it, and, praise
the Lord! I practise it!"</p>

<h3 class="left">GRAMMAR</h3>

<p>The passing lady mistakenly supposed that the woman shouting from a
window down the street was calling to the little girl minding baby
brother close by on the curb.</p>

<p>"Your mother is calling you," she said kindly.</p>

<p>The little girl corrected the lady:</p>

<p>"Her ain't a-callin' we. Us don't belong to she."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The teacher asked the little girl if she was going to the Maypole dance.
"No, I ain't going," was the reply.</p>

<p>The teacher corrected the child:</p>

<p>"You must not say, 'I ain't going,' you must say, 'I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> am not going.'"
And she added to impress the point: "I am not going. He is not going. We
are not going. You are not going. They are not going. Now, dear, can you
say all that?"</p>

<p>The little girl nodded and smiled brightly.</p>

<p>"Sure!" she replied. "They ain't nobody going."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The witness, in answer to the lawyer's question, said:</p>

<p>"Them hain't the boots what was stole."</p>

<p>The judge rebuked the witness sternly:</p>

<p>"Speak grammatic, young man&mdash;speak grammatic! You shouldn't ought to
say, 'them boots what was stole,' you should ought to say, 'them boots
as was stealed.'"</p>

<h3 class="left">GRASS</h3>

<p>The auctioneer, offering the pasture lot for sale, waved his hand
enthusiastically, pointed toward the rich expanse of herbage, and
shouted:</p>

<p>"Now, then, how much am I offered for this field? Jest look at that
grass, gentlemen. That's exactly the sort of grass Nebuchadnezzar would
have given two hundred dollars an acre for."</p>

<h3 class="left">GREED</h3>

<p>An eminent doctor successfully attended a sick child. A few days later,
the grateful mother called on the physician. After expressing her
realization of the fact that his services had been of a sort that could
not be fully paid for, she continued:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p><p>"But I hope you will accept as a token from me this purse which I myself
have embroidered."</p>

<p>The physician replied very coldly to the effect that the fees of the
physician must be paid in money, not merely in gratitude, and he added:</p>

<p>"Presents maintain friendship: they do not maintain a family."</p>

<p>"What is your fee?" the woman inquired.</p>

<p>"Two hundred dollars," was the answer.</p>

<p>The woman opened the purse, and took from it five $100 bills. She put
back three, handed two to the discomfited physician, then took her
departure.</p>

<h3 class="left">GRIEF</h3>

<p>At the wake, the bereaved husband displayed all the evidences of frantic
grief. He cried aloud heart-rendingly, and tore his hair. The other
mourners had to restrain him from leaping into the open coffin.</p>

<p>The next day, a friend who had been at the wake encountered the widower
on the street and spoke sympathetically of the great woe displayed by
the man.</p>

<p>"Did you go to the cemetery for the burying?" the stricken husband
inquired anxiously, and when he was answered in the negative, continued
proudly: "It's a pity ye weren't there. Ye ought to have seen the way I
cut up."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The old woman in indigent circumstances was explaining to a visitor, who
found her at breakfast, a long category of trials and tribulations.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p><p>"And," she concluded, "this very morning, I woke up at four o'clock, and
cried and cried till breakfast time, and as soon as I finish my tea I'll
begin again, and probably keep it up all day."</p>

<h3 class="left">HABIT</h3>

<p>It was the bridegroom's third matrimonial undertaking, and the bride's
second. When the clergyman on whom they had called for the ceremony
entered the parlor, he found the couple comfortably seated. They made no
effort to rise, so, as he opened the book to begin the service, he
directed them, "Please, stand up."</p>

<p>The bridegroom looked at the bride, and the bride stared back at him,
and then both regarded the clergyman, while the man voiced their
decision in a tone that was quite polite, but very firm:</p>

<p>"We have ginerally sot."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>It is a matter of common knowledge that there have been troublous times
in Ireland before those of the present. In the days of the Land League,
an Irish Judge told as true of an experience while he was holding court
in one of the turbulent sections. When the jury entered the court-room
at the beginning of the session, the bailiff directed them to take their
accustomed places.... And every man of them walked forward into the
dock.</p>

<h3 class="left">HAIR</h3>

<p>The school girl from Avenue A, who had just learned that the notorious
Gorgon sisters had snakes for hair, chewed her gum thoughtfully as she
commented:</p>

<p>"Tough luck to have to get out and grab a mess of snakes any time you
want an extry puff."</p>

<h3 class="left">HARD TO PLEASE</h3>

<p>The rather ferocious-appearing husband who had taken his wife to the
beach for a holiday scowled heavily at an amateur photographer, and
rumbled in a threatening bass voice:</p>

<p>"What the blazes d'ye mean, photographin' my wife? I saw ye when ye done
it."</p>

<p>The man addressed cringed, and replied placatingly:</p>

<p>"You're mistaken, really! I wouldn't think of doing such a thing."</p>

<p>"Ye wouldn't, eh?" the surly husband growled, still more savagely. "And
why not? I'd like to know. She's the handsomest woman on the beach."</p>

<h3 class="left">HASTE</h3>

<p>The colored man was condemned to be hanged, and was awaiting the time
set for execution in a Mississippi jail. Since all other efforts had
failed him, he addressed a letter to the governor, with a plea for
executive <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>clemency. The opening paragraph left no doubt as to his
urgent need:</p>

<p>"Dear Boss: The white folks is got me in dis jail fixin' to hang me on
Friday mornin' and here it is Wednesday already."</p>

<h3 class="left">HEARSAY</h3>

<p>The convicted feudist was working for a pardon. It was reported to him
that the opposing clan was pulling wires against him, and spreading
false reports concerning him. He thereupon wrote a brief missive to the
governor:</p>

<p>"Deer guvner, if youve heared wat ive heared youve heared youve heared a
lie."</p>

<h3 class="left">HEAVEN</h3>

<p>The clergyman in the following story probably did not mean exactly what
he said, though, human nature being what it is, maybe it was true
enough.</p>

<p>A parishioner meeting the parson in the street inquired:</p>

<p>"When do you expect to see Deacon Jones again?"</p>

<p>"Never, never again!" the minister declared solemnly. "The deacon is in
heaven!"</p>

<h3 class="left">HELP</h3>

<p>The farmer found his new hired man very unsatisfactory. A neighbor who
chanced along inquired:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p><p>"How's that new hand o' your'n?"</p>

<p>"Cuss the critter!" was the bitter reply. "He ain't a hand&mdash;he's a sore
thumb."</p>

<p>A savage old boar got into a garden, and was doing much damage. When two
men tried to drive it out, the animal charged. One of the two climbed a
tree, the other dodged, and laid hold on the boar's tail. He hung on
desperately, and man and beast raced wildly round and round the tree.
Finally, the man shouted between gasps:</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, Bill, climb down here, and help me leggo this ornery
old hog!"</p>

<h3 class="left">HELPFULNESS</h3>

<p>Many a mayor is a friend to the people&mdash;just like his honor in the
following story.</p>

<p>A taxpayer entered the office of the water registrar in a small city,
and explained himself and his business there as follows:</p>

<p>"My name is O'Rafferty. And my cellar is full of wather, and my hins
will all be drowned intirely if it ain't fixed. And I'm here to inform
yez that I'm wantin' it fixed."</p>

<p>It was explained to the complainant that the remedy for his need must be
sought at the office of the mayor, and he therefore departed to
interview that official.</p>

<p>After an interval of a few days, O'Rafferty made a second visit to the
office of the registrar.</p>

<p>"Sure, and I've come agin to tell yez that my cellar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> is now fuller of
water than ever it was before. And I'm tellin' yez that I want it fixed,
and I'm a man that carries votes in my pocket."</p>

<p>The registrar again explained that he was powerless in the matter, and
that the only recourse must be to the mayor.</p>

<p>"The mayor is ut!" O'Rafferty snorted. "Sure and didn't I see the mayor?
I did thot! And what did the mayor say to me? Huh! he said, 'Mr.
O'Rafferty, why don't you keep ducks?'"</p>

<h3 class="left">HEN</h3>

<p>The customer asked for fresh eggs, and the clerk in the London shop
said:</p>

<p>"Them are fresh which has a hen on 'em."</p>

<p>"But I don't see any hen."</p>

<p>The clerk explained patiently.</p>

<p>"Not the fowl, mum, but the letter <i>hen</i>. <i>Hen</i> stands for <i>noo-laid</i>."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," Alice declared, "I'm tickled we have such a fine doctor."</p>

<h3 class="left">HEREDITY</h3>

<p>The woman, who had a turn-up nose and was somewhat self-conscious
concerning it, bought a new pug dog, and petted it so fondly as to
excite the jealousy of her little daughter.</p>

<p>"How do you like your new little brother?" she asked the child
teasingly.</p>

<p>The girl replied, rather maliciously, perhaps:</p>

<p>"He looks just like his muvver."</p>

<h3 class="left">HIGH PRICES</h3>

<p>Two men were talking together in the Public Library. One of them said:</p>

<p>"The dime novel has gone. I wonder where it's gone to?"</p>

answered cynically:</p>

<p>Mike, the hod-carrier, was still somewhat fuddled when he arose Monday
morning, with the result that he put on his overalls wrong side to; with
the further result, that he was careless while mounting the ladder later
with a load of bricks, and fell to the ground. As he raised himself into
a sitting position, a fellow workman asked solicitously:</p>

<p>"Are yez kilt intoirly, Mike?"</p>

<p>Mike, with drooping head, stared down dully at the seat of his overalls,
and shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he declared in a tone of awe, "I'm not kilt, but I'm terrible
twisted."</p>

<p>A rustic visitor to the city made a desperate run for the ferry boat as
it was leaving the slip. He made a mighty leap, and covered the
intervening space, then fell sprawling to the deck, where he lay stunned

the wide expanse of water between boat and shore.</p>

<p>"Holy hop-toads!" he exclaimed in a tone of profound awe. "What a jump!"</p>

<h3 class="left">HISTORY</h3>

<p>The faculty were arranging the order of examinations. It was agreed that
the harder subjects should be placed first in the list. It was proposed
that history should have the final place. The woman teacher of that
subject protested:</p>

<p>"But it is certainly one of the easiest subjects," the head of the
faculty declared.</p>

<p>The young woman shook her head, and spoke firmly:</p>

<p>"Not the way I teach it. Indeed, according to my method, it is a very
difficult study, and most perplexing."</p>

<p>Down in Virginia, near Yorktown, lived an aged negro whose proud boast
was that he had been the body servant of George Washington. As he was
very old indeed, no one could disprove his claims, and he made the most
of his historical pretentions. He was full of anecdotes concerning the
Father of His Country, and exploited himself in every tale. His favorite
narrative was of the capture of Lord Cornwallis by his master, which was
as follows:</p>

<p>"Yassuh, it were right on dis yere road, jest over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> dar by de fo'ks.

<h3 class="left">HOGS</h3>

<p>The professor and his wife were doubtful about returning to the farm on
which they had passed the previous summer, because they had been
somewhat annoyed by the proximity of the pigsty to the house. Finally,
the professor wrote to the farmer and explained the objectionable
feature. He received the following reply:</p>

<p>"We hain't had no hogs on the place since you was here last summer. Be
sure to come."</p>

<h3 class="left">HOLDING HIS OWN</h3>

<h3 class="left">HOMESICKNESS</h3>

<p>One of our volunteers in the late war lost some of his first enthusiasm
under the bitter experience of campaigning. One night at the front in
France, while his company was stationed in a wood, a lieutenant
discovered the recruit sitting on a log and weeping bitterly. The
officer spoke roughly:</p>

<p>"Now, what are you bawling about, you big baby?"</p>

<p>"I wish I was in my daddy's barn!" replied the soldier in a plaintive
voice.</p>

<p>"In your daddy's barn!" the astonished lieutenant exclaimed. "What for?
What would you do if you were in your daddy's barn?"</p>

She returned in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> due time, and passed along the hotel corridor to the
door, on which she tapped daintily.</p>

<p>"I'm back, honey&mdash;let me in," she murmured with wishful tenderness. But
there was no answer vouchsafed to her plea. She knocked a little more
firmly, and raised her voice somewhat to call again:</p>

<p>"Honey, honey&mdash;it's Susie! Let me in!"</p>

<p>Thereupon a very cold masculine voice sounded through the door:</p>

<p>"Madam, this is not a beehive; it's a bathroom!"</p>

during this time of trial she should have the very finest kitten to be
found.</p>

<p>As Mary was coming out from the influence of the anesthetic, the nurse

<p>"It's a bum way to get a cat."</p>

<p>The good wife apologized to her unexpected guests for serving the apple
pie without cheese. The little boy of the family slipped quietly away
from the table for a moment, and returned with a cube of cheese, which
he laid on the guest's plate. The visitor smiled in recognition of the
lad's thoughtfulness, popped the cheese into his mouth, and then
remarked:</p>

<p>Two boys once thought to play a trick on Charles Darwin. They took the

<p>The boys replied enthusiastically, in one voice:</p>

<h3 class="left">IMPATIENCE</h3>

<p>An acquaintance encountered in the village inquired of Farmer Jones
concerning his wife, who was seriously ill. That worthy scowled and
spat, and finally answered in a tone of fretful dejection:</p>

<p>"Seems like Elmiry's falin' drefful slow. Dinged if I don't wish as how
she'd git well, or somethin'."</p>

<h3 class="left">IMPUDENCE</h3>

<p>The ice on the river was in perfect condition. A small boy, with his
skates on his arm, knocked at the door of the Civil War veteran, who had
lost a leg at Antietam. When the door was opened by the old man, the boy
asked:</p>

<p>"Are you going out to-day, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, I guess not, sonny," was the answer. "Why?"</p>

<p>"If you ain't," the boy suggested, "I thought I might like to borrow
your wooden leg to play hockey."</p>

<h3 class="left">INDIRECTION</h3>

<p>The bashful suitor finally nerved himself to the supreme effort:</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;Jenny, do you&mdash;think&mdash;er&mdash;your mother might&mdash;er&mdash;seriously
consider&mdash;er&mdash;becoming my&mdash;er-mother-in-law?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">INHERITANCE</h3>

<p>A lawyer made his way to the edge of the excavation where a gang was
working, and called the name of Timothy O'Toole.</p>

<p>"Who's wantin' me?" inquired a heavy voice.</p>

<p>"Mr. O'Toole," the lawyer asked, "did you come from Castlebar, County
Mayo?"</p>

<p>"I did that."</p>

<p>"And your mother was named Bridget and your father Michael?"</p>

<p>"They was."</p>

<p>"It is my duty, then," said the lawyer, "to inform you, Mr. O'Toole,
that your Aunt Mary has died in Iowa, leaving you an estate of sixty
thousand dollars."</p>

<p>There was a short silence below, and then a lively commotion.</p>

<p>"Are you coming, Mr. O'Toole?" the lawyer called down.</p>

<p>"In wan minute," was bellowed in answer. "I've just stopped to lick the
foreman."</p>

<p>It required just six months of extremely riotous living for O'Toole to
expend all of the sixty thousand dollars. His chief endeavor was to
satisfy a huge inherited thirst.</p>

<p>Then he went back to his job. And there, presently, the lawyer sought
him out again.</p>

<p>"It's your Uncle Patrick, this time, Mr. O'Toole," the lawyer explained.
"He has died in Texas, and left you forty thousand dollars."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p><p>O'Toole leaned heavily on his pick, and shook his head in great
weariness.</p>

<p>"I don't think I can take it," he declared. "I'm not as strong as I
wance was, and I misdoubt me that I could go through all that money and
live."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>In a London theatre, a tragedy was being played. The aged king tottered
to and fro on the stage as he declaimed:</p>

<p>"On which one of my two sons shall I bestow the crown?"</p>

<p>A voice came down from the gallery:</p>

<p>"Hi saye, guv'nor, myke it 'arf a crown apiece."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>Said one Tommy to another:</p>

<p>"That's a snortin' pipe, Bill. Where'd you happen on it?"</p>

<p>"It was pussonal property of a Boche what tried to take me prisoner,"
was the answer. "Inherited it from him."</p>

<h3 class="left">INITIATIVE</h3>

<p>The sweet little girl had a violent tussle with her particular chum. Her
mother reprimanded her, and concluded by saying:</p>

<p>"It was Satan who suggested to you the pulling of Jenny's hair."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised," the child replied musingly. "But," she added
proudly, "kicking her in the shins was entirely my own idea."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">INJUSTICE</h3>

<p>The child sat by the road bawling loudly. A passer-by asked him what was
the matter.</p>

<p>"My ma, she's gone and drowned the kittens," the boy wailed.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't that too bad!" was the sympathetic response.</p>

<p>The child bawled the louder.</p>

<p>"An' ma she promised me that I could drown 'em."</p>

<h3 class="left">INNOCENCE</h3>

<p>A little girl four years old was alone in the nursery with the door
closed and fastened when her little brother arrived and expressed a
desire to come in. The following was the dialogue:</p>

<p>"I wants to tum in, Sissy."</p>

<p>"But you tan't tum in, Tom."</p>

<p>"But I wants to."</p>

<p>"Well, I'se in my nightie gown an' nurse says little boys mus'n't see
little girls in their nightie gowns."</p>

<p>There was a period of silence during which the astonished little boy
reflected on the mystery. It was ended by Sissy's calling out:</p>

<p>"You tan tum in now, Tom&mdash;I tooked it off."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The very young clergyman made his first parochial call. He tried to
admire the baby, and asked how old it was.</p>

<p>"Just ten weeks old," the proud mother replied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p><p>And the very young clergyman inquired interestedly:</p>

<p>"And is it your youngest?"</p>

<h3 class="left">INQUISITIVENESS</h3>

<p>In the smoking car, one of the passengers had an empty coatsleeve. The
sharer of his seat was of an inquisitive turn, and after a vain effort
to restrain his curiosity, finally hemmed and hawed, and said:</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, sir, but I see you've lost an arm."</p>

<p>The one-armed man picked up the empty sleeve in his remaining hand, and
felt of it with every evidence of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!" he exclaimed. "I do believe you're right."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The curiosity of the passenger was excited by the fact that his seatmate
had his right arm in a sling, and the following dialogue occurred:</p>

<p>"You broke your arm, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I did."</p>

<p>"Had an accident, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. I did it in trying to pat myself on the back."</p>

<p>"My land! On the back! Now, whatever did you want to pat yourself on the
back for?"</p>

<p>"Just for minding my own business."</p>

<h3 class="left">INSOMNIA</h3>

<p>The man suffering from insomnia quite often makes a mistake in calling
the doctor, when what he needs is the preacher.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">INSULT</h3>

<p>The young wife greeted her husband tearfully on his return from the
day's work.</p>

<p>"Oh, Willie, darling," she gasped, "I have been so insulted!"</p>

<p>"Insulted!" Willie exclaimed wrathfully. "Insulted by whom?"</p>

<p>"By your mother!" the wife declared, and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>The husband was aghast, but inclined to be skeptical.</p>

<p>"By my mother, Ella? Why, dearest, that's nonsense. She's a hundred
miles away."</p>

<p>"But she did," the wife insisted. "A letter came to you this morning,
and it was addressed in your mother's writing, so, of course, I opened
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course," Willie agreed, without any enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"And it was written to you all the whole way through, every word of it,
except&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except what?"</p>

<p>"Except the postscript," the wife flared. "That was the insult&mdash;that was
to me." The tears flowed again. "It said: 'P. S.&mdash;Dear Ella, don't fail
to give this letter to Willie. I want him to read it.'"</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>Tom Corwin was remarkable for the size of his mouth. He claimed that he
had been insulted by a deacon of his church.</p>

<p>"When I stood up in the class meeting, to relate my experience," Corwin
explained, "and opened my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> mouth, the Deacon rose up in front and said,
'Will some brother please close that window, and keep it closed!'"</p>

<h3 class="left">INSURANCE</h3>

<p>The woman at the insurance office inquired as to the costs, amounts
paid, etc.</p>

<p>"So," she concluded, "if I pay five dollars, you pay me a thousand if my
house burns down. But do you ask questions about how the fire came to
start?"</p>

<p>"We make careful investigation, of course," the agent replied.</p>

<p>The woman flounced toward the door disgustedly.</p>

<p>"Just as I thought," she called over her shoulder. "I knew there was a
catch in it."</p>

<h3 class="left">INTERMISSION</h3>

<p>During a lecture, Artemas Ward once startled the crowd of listeners by
announcing a fifteen-minute intermission. After contemplating the
audience for a few minutes, he relieved their bewilderment by saying:</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, in order to pass the time, we will proceed with the
lecture."</p>

<h3 class="left">INVENTORS</h3>

<p>The profiteer, skimming over the advertisements in his morning paper,
looked across the damask and silver and cut glass at his wife, and
remarked enviously:</p>

<p>"These inventors make the money. Take cleaners, now, I'll bet that
feller Vacuum has cleared millions."</p>

<h3 class="left">JOKES</h3>

<p>The joke maker's association had a feast. They exploited their humorous
abilities, and all made merry, save one glum guest. At last, they
insisted that this melancholy person should contribute to the
entertainment. He consented, in response to much urging, to offer a
conundrum:</p>

<p>"What is the difference between me and a turkey?"</p>

<p>When none could guess the answer, the glum individual explained:</p>

<p>"I am alive. They stuff turkeys with chestnuts after they are dead."</p>

<h3 class="left">KINSHIP</h3>

<p>The urchin was highly excited, and well he might be when we consider his
explanation:</p>

<p>"They got twins up to sisters. One twin, he's a boy, an' one twin, she's
a girl, an' so I'm a uncle an' a aunt."</p>

<p>The Southern lady interrogated her colored cook,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> Matilda, concerning a
raid made on the chicken-house during the night.</p>

<p>"You sleep right close to the chicken-house, Matilda, and it seems to me
you must have heard the noise when those thieves were stealing the
chickens."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," Matilda admitted, with an expression of grief on her dusky
features. "I heerd de chickens holler, an' I heerd the voices ob de
men."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you go out and stop them?" the mistress demanded.</p>

<p>Matilda wept.</p>

<p>"Case, ma'am," she exclaimed, "I know'd my old fadder was dar, an' I
wouldn't hab him know I'se los' confidence in him foh all de chickens in
de world. If I had gone out dar an' kotched him, it would have broke his

him."</p>

<h3 class="left">KISSES</h3>

<p>The bridegroom, who was in a horribly nervous condition, appealed to the
clergyman in a loud whisper, at the close of the ceremony:</p>

<p>"Is it kisstomary to cuss the bride?"</p>

<p>The clergyman might have replied:</p>

<p>"Not yet, but soon."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The young man addressed the old grouch:</p>

<p>"When a fellow has taken a girl to a show, and fed her candy, and given
her supper, and taken her home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> in a taxi, shouldn't she let a fellow
kiss her good-night?"</p>

<p>The old grouch snorted.</p>

<p>"Humph! He's already done more than enough for her."</p>

<h3 class="left">KISSING</h3>

<p>The subject of kissing was debated with much earnestness for a half hour
between the girl and her young man caller. The fellow insisted that it
was always possible for a man to kiss a girl at will, whether she chose
to permit it or not. The maiden was firm in maintaining that such was
not the case. Finally, it was decided that the only solution of the
question must be by a practical demonstration one way or the other. So,
they tried it. They clinched, and the battle was on. After a lively
tussle, they broke away. The girl had been kissed&mdash;ardently for a period
of minutes. Her comment showed an undaunted spirit:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you really didn't win fair. My foot slipped ... Let's try it
again."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The tiny boy fell down and bumped his head. His Uncle Bill picked the
child up, with the remark:</p>

<p>"Now I'll kiss it, and the pain will all be gone."</p>

<p>The youngster recovered his smiles under the treatment, and then, as he
was set down, addressed his uncle eagerly:</p>

<p>"Come down in the kitchen&mdash;the cook has the toothache."</p>

<p>Some Scottish deacons were famous, if not notorious, for the readiness
with which they could expound any passage of Scripture. It is recorded
of a certain elder that as he read and commented on the thirty-fourth
Psalm, he misread the sentence, "Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips
from speaking guile." He carelessly read the last two words: "squeaking
girls." But the astonishing phrase did not dismay him in the least, or
cause him to hesitate in his exegesis. He expounded instantly and
solemnly:</p>

<p>"It is evident from this passage, my brethren, that the Scripture does
not absolutely forbid kissing, but, as in Christianity everything is to
be done decently and in order, we are here encouraged by this passage to
choose rather those girls that take it quietly, in preference to those
that squeak under the operation."</p>

<p>There was a town jail, and there was a county jail. The fact was worth
forty dollars to the lawyer who was approached by an old darky in behalf
of a son languishing in duress. The lawyer surveyed the tattered client
as he listened, and decided that he would be lucky to obtain a
ten-dollar fee. He named that amount as necessary to secure the
prisoner's release. Thereupon, the old colored man drew forth a large
roll of bills, and peeled off a ten. The lawyer's greedy eyes popped.</p>

<p>"What jail is your son in?" he inquired craftily.</p>

<p>"In the county jail."</p>

<p>"In the county jail!" was the exclamation in a tone of dismay. "That's
bad&mdash;very bad. It will cost you at least fifty dollars."</p>

<h3 class="left">LIARS</h3>

<p>The World War has incited veterans of the Civil War to new reminiscences
of old happenings. One of these is based on the fact that furloughs were
especially difficult to obtain when the Union army was in front of
Petersburg, Virginia. But a certain Irishman was resolved to get a
furlough in spite of the ban. He went to the colonel's tent, and was
permitted to enter. He saluted, and delivered himself thus:</p>

<p>"Colonel, I've come to ax you to allow me the pleasure of a furlough for
a visit home. I've been in the field now three years, an' never home yet
to see me family. An' I jest had a letter from me wife wantin' av me to
come home to see her an' the children."</p>

<p>The colonel shook his head decisively.</p>

<p>"No, Mike," he replied. "I'm sorry, but to tell the truth, I don't think
you ought to go home. I've jest had a letter from your wife myself. She
doesn't want you to come home. She writes me that you'd only get drunk,
and disgrace her and the children. So you'd better stay right here until
your term of service expires."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," Mike answered, quite cheerfully. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> saluted and went
to the door of the tent. Then he faced about.</p>

<p>"Colonel dear," he inquired in a wheedling voice, "would ye be after
pardonin' me for a brief remark jist at this toime?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," the officer assented.</p>

<p>"Ye won't git mad an' put me in the guard house for freein' me mind, so
to spake?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed! Say what you wish to."</p>

<p>"Well, thin, Colonel darlint, I'm afther thinkin' thar are at the

<h3 class="left">LIES</h3>

<p>A certain famous preacher when preaching one Sunday in the summer time
observed that many among the congregation ware drowsing. Suddenly, then,
he paused, and afterward continued in a loud voice, relating an incident
that had no connection whatever with his sermon. This was to the
following effect:</p>

<p>"I was once riding along a country road. I came to the house of a
farmer, and halted to observe one of the most remarkable sights I have
ever seen. There was a sow with a litter of ten little pigs. This sow
and each of her offspring had a long curved horn growing out of the
forehead between the ears."</p>

<p>The clergyman again paused, and ran his eye over the congregation.
Everybody was now wide-awake. He thereupon remarked:</p>

<p>"Behold how strange! A few minutes since, when I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> was telling you the
truth, you went to sleep. But now when you have heard a whopping lie,
you are all wide-awake."</p>

<p>The woman was strong-minded, and she was religious, and she was also
afflicted with a very feminine fear of thunder storms. She was
delivering an address at a religious convention when a tempest suddenly
broke with din of thunder and flare of lightning. Above the noise of the
elements, her voice was heard in shrill supplication:</p>

<p>"O Lord, take us under Thy protecting wings, for Thou knowest that

ran as follows:</p>

<p>"Yep," the store-keeper answered briskly, "life-preservers, invalid
cushions, funeral wreaths, doughnuts, an' sich."</p>

<h3 class="left">LOGIC</h3>

<p>The mother came on her little son who was standing thoughtfully before
the gooseberry bush in the garden. She noted that his expression was
both puzzled and distressed.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter, little lamb?" she asked tenderly.</p>

<p>"I'm finkin, muvver," the boy answered.</p>

<p>"What about, little man?"</p>

<p>"Have gooseberries any legs, muvver?"</p>

<p>"Why, no! Of course not, dear."</p>

<p>The perplexity passed from the little boy's face, but the expression of
trouble deepened, as he spoke again:</p>

<p>"Then, muvver, I fink I've swallowed a catapillar."</p>

<p>The two old Scotchmen played a round of seventeen holes without a word
exchanged between them. As they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> came to the eighteenth green, Sandy
surveyed the lie, and muttered:</p>

<p>"Chatter-r-rbox!"</p>

<h3 class="left">LOVE</h3>

<p>The philosopher calmly defined the exact difference between life and

<p>"Life is just one fool thing after another: love is just two fool things

<h3 class="left">LOVE ME, LOVE ME NOT</h3>

<p>The little girl came in tears to her mother.</p>

<p>"God doesn't love me," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Of course, God loves you," the mother declared. "How did you ever come
to get such an idea?"</p>

<p>"No," the child persisted, "He doesn't love me. I know&mdash;I tried Him with
a daisy."</p>

<p>The pessimist quoted from his own experience at poker in illustration of
the general cussedness of things:</p>

<p>"Frequent, I have sot in a poker game, and it sure is queer how things

takin' a pot. And then, 'long about four o'clock in the mornin', the

<h3 class="left">LUNACY</h3>

<p>The lunatic peered over the asylum wall, and saw a man fishing from the
bank of the river that ran close by. It was raining hard, which cooled
the fevered brow of the lunatic and enabled him to think with great
clearness. In consequence, he called down to the drenched fisherman:</p>

<p>"Caught anything?"</p>

<p>The man on the bank looked up, and shook his head glumly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p><p>"How long you been there?" the lunatic next demanded.</p>

<p>The tender young mother detected her baby boy in a deliberate lie. With
tears in her eyes, and a catch in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> her voice, she sought to impress upon
him the enormity of his offense.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she questioned severely, "what happens to little boys who
tell falsehoods?"</p>

<p>The culprit shook his head in great distress, and the mother explained
carefully:</p>

<p>"Why, a great big black man, with horns on his head and one eye in the
center of his forehead, comes along and grabs the little boy who has
told a falsehood, and flies with him up to the moon, and keeps him there
sifting ashes all the rest of his life. You won't ever tell another
falsehood, will you, darling? It's wicked!"</p>

<p>Mother's baby boy regarded the speaker with round-eyed admiration.</p>

<p>"Oh, ma," he gurgled, "what a whopper!"</p>

you're going to marry."</p>

<p>The unhappy man explained the cause of his wretchedness:</p>

<p>"I've never made a speech in my life. But last night at the dinner at

began like this:</p>

<p>It is told of Prince Herbert Bismarck that at a reception in the Royal
Palace in Berlin he rudely jostled a high dignitary of the Italian

<p>The tenderfoot in the Western town asked for coffee and rolls at the
lunch counter. He was served by the waitress, and there was no saucer
for the cup.</p>

<p>"What about the saucer?" he asked.</p>

<p>The girl explained:</p>

<p>"We don't hand out saucers no more. We found, if we did, like's not,

<p>"Let us begin at the beginning," said the judge. "Where did you first
meet this woman who has thus abused you?"</p>

<p>The little man shuddered, and looked everywhere except at his wife as he
replied:</p>

<p>"I never did, so to say, meet up with her. She jest naturally overtook

<p>The solemn ceremony of marriage was being performed for the blushing
young bride and the elderly gentleman who had been thrice widowed. There
was a sound of loud sobs from the next room. The guests were startled,
but a member of the bridegroom's family explained:</p>

<p>"That's only our Jane. She always cries when Pa is gettin' married."</p>

to him whatever.</p>

<p>"Do you know who I am?" the officer demanded.</p>

<p>The sentry shook his head. "Mebby, the veterinarian, or the barber, or

seven daughters, all unmarried, which was sent to the upholsterer to be
repaired, that, when taken apart, the following articles were
discovered:</p>

<p>Forty-seven hairpins, three mustache combs, nineteen suspender buttons,
thirteen needles, eight cigarettes, four photographs, two hundred and
seventeen pins, some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> grains of coffee, a number of cloves, twenty-seven
cuff-buttons, six pocket-knives, fifteen poker-chips, a vial of
homeopathic medicine for the nerves, thirty-four lumps of chewing-gum,

<h3 class="left">MISTAKEN IDENTITY</h3>

<p>The raw Irishman was told by the farmer for whom he worked that the
pumpkins in the corn patch were mule's eggs, which only needed someone
to sit on them to hatch. Pat was ambitious to own a mule, and, selecting
a large pumpkin, he sat on it industriously every moment he could steal
from his work. Came a day when he grew impatient, and determined to
hasten the hatching. He stamped on the pumpkin. As it broke open, a
startled rabbit broke from its cover in an adjacent corn shock and
scurried across the field. Pat chased it, shouting:</p>

<p>"Hi, thar! Stop! don't yez know your own father?"</p>

<p>The meek-looking gentleman arose hastily and offered his seat in the car
to the self-assertive woman who had entered and glared at him. She gave
him no thanks as she seated herself, but she spoke in a heavy voice that
filled the whole car:</p>

<p>"What are you standing up there for? Come here, and sit on my lap."</p>

<p>The modest man turned scarlet as he huskily faltered:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p><p>"I fear, madam, that I am not worthy of such an honor."</p>

<p>The little man was perfectly harmless, but the lady sitting next to him
in the car was a spinster, and suspicious of all males. So, since they
were somewhat crowded on the seat, she pushed the umbrella between her
knee and his and held it firmly as a barrier. A shower came up, and the
woman when she left the car, put up the umbrella. As she did so, she
perceived that the little man had followed her. She had guessed that he
was a masher, now she knew it. She walked quickly down the side street,
and the man pursued through the driving rain. She ran up the steps of
her home, and rang the bell. When she heard the servant coming to the
door, feeling herself safe at last, she faced about and addressed her
pursuer angrily:</p>

<p>"How dare you follow me! How dare you! What do you want, anyhow?"</p>

<p>The drenched little man at the foot of the steps spoke pleadingly:</p>

<p>"If you please, ma'am, I want my umbrella."</p>

<p>The traveling salesman instructed the porter that he must leave the
train at Cleveland, where he was due at three o'clock in the morning. He
explained that violence might be necessary because he did not wake

<p>The drummer awoke at six in the morning, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> Cleveland far behind. In
a rage, he sought the porter. The colored man was in a highly disheveled
state and his face was bruised badly. His eyes popped at sight of the
furious traveling man, who allowed no opportunity for explanations or
excuses. He did all the talking, and did it forcibly. When at last the
outraged salesman went away, the porter shook his head dismally, and
muttered:</p>

the afternoon, and that any infants to receive the rite should be
brought to the church at that time.</p>

<p>The old clergyman, who was deaf, thought that his assistant was speaking
of the new hymnals, and he added a bit of information:</p>

little girl was nervous over the strangeness of her surroundings, but
the mother comforted her, saying:</p>

instructions:</p>

<p>"If he asks your name, say Emma Jane; if he asks how old you are, say
you are eight years old; if he asks who made you, say God made me."</p>

<p>It is a fact that the clergyman did ask just those three questions in
that order, to the first two of which Emma replied correctly. But it is
also a fact that when the minister propounded the third query, as to her
origin, the child hesitated, and then said:</p>

<p>"Mama did tell me the man's name, but I've gone and forgotten it."</p>

<p>The editor of a country newspaper betook himself to a party at the house
of a neighbor, where, only a few weeks earlier, a baby had been added to
the family. On the editor's arrival at the house, he was met at the door
by his hostess, a woman who suffered to some extent from deafness. After
the usual exchange of greetings, the editor inquired concerning the
health of the baby. The hostess had a severe cold, and she now
misunderstood the visitor's inquiry concerning the baby, thinking that
he was solicitous on her account. So she explained to the aghast editor
who had asked about the baby that, although she usually had one every
winter, this was the very worst one she had ever had, it kept her awake
at night a great deal, and at first confined her to her bed. Having
explained thus far, the good lady noticed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> flabbergasted air of her
guest. She continued sympathetically; saying that she could tell by his
looks and the way he acted that he was going to have one just like hers.
Then she insisted that, as a precautionary measure for the sake of his

<h3 class="left">MISMATED</h3>

<p>A Texas lad, lacking a team of horses or oxen or mules for his
ploughing, engaged his sister to direct the plough, while he yoked
himself to a steer for the pulling. The steer promptly ran away, and the
lad had no choice but to run too. They came shortly into the village and
went tearing down the street. And as he raced wildly, the young man
shouted:</p>

<p>"Here we come&mdash;darn our fool souls! Somebody head us off!"</p>

<h3 class="left">MIXED METAPHORS</h3>

<p>A babu, or native clerk, in India, who prided himself on his mastery of
the English tongue and skill in its idioms, sent the following telegram
in announcement of his mother's death:</p>

<p>"Regret to announce that hand which rocked the cradle has kicked the
bucket."</p>

<h3 class="left">MODESTY</h3>

<p>A British journalist, in an article on Sir Henry Irving for a London

<h3 class="left">MONEY TALKS</h3>

<p>The disreputable-looking panhandler picked out an elderly gentleman of
most benevolent aspect and made a plea for a small financial
contribution. When he had finished his narrative of misery and woe the
elderly gentleman replied benignantly:</p>

<p>"My good friend, I have no money, but I can give you some good advice."</p>

<p>The tramp spat contemptuously, and uttered an oath of disgust.</p>

<p>"If you hain't got no money," he jeered, "I reckon your advice ain't
worth hearin'."</p>

<h3 class="left">MONEY VALUE</h3>

<p>A well-known millionaire entertained Edward Everett Hale with other
guests at a dinner. The host was not only hospitable, but wished every
one to know his liberality. During the meal, he extolled the various
viands, and did not hesitate to give their value in dollars and cents.
In speaking of some very beautiful grapes served, which had been grown
on his estate, he wearied the company by a careful calculation as to
just how much a stem of them had cost him. Doctor Hale grinned
pleasantly as he extended his empty plate, with the request:</p>

<p>"I'll thank you to cut me off about $1.87 worth more, please."</p>

<p>The wives of the savage chief questioned the wife of the missionary:</p>

<p>"And you never let your husband beat you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," the Christian lady replied. "Why, he wouldn't dare to
try such a thing!"</p>

<p>The oldest wife nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"It is plain enough why the foreign devil has only one wife."</p>

<h3 class="left">MONOTONY</h3>

<p>The son of the house addressed his mother wistfully.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have a little sister some day, ain't I?"</p>

<p>The child nodded seriously.</p>

<p>"Yes, mama, I do. It gets kin' o' tiresome teasin' the cat."</p>

<h3 class="left">MORALITY</h3>

<p>The more-or-less-religious woman was deeply shocked when the new
neighbors sent over on Sunday morning to borrow her lawn-mower.</p>

<p>"The very idea," she exclaimed to her maid, "of cutting grass on the
Sabbath! Shameful! Certainly, they can't have it. Tell them we haven't
any lawn-mower."</p>

<h3 class="left">MOSQUITOES</h3>

<p>The visitor from another state talked so much concerning the size and
fierceness of New Jersey mosquitoes that his host became somewhat
peeved.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p><p>"Funny!" the guest remarked. "You haven't your porch screened."</p>

<p>A visitor in the South complained bitterly concerning the plague of
mosquitoes. An aged negro who listened respectfully explained a method
by which the pests might be endured. But this was in the days before
prohibition.</p>

<p>"My old Marse George, suh, he done managed them animiles sholy
splendiferous. Always when he come home nights, he so completely
intoxicated he don't care a cuss foh all the skeeters in the hull

<h3 class="left">MOTTO</h3>

<p>Two men walking along Avenue A in New York City observed a dingy saloon,
in the window of which was a framed sign, reading:</p>

<p>"<i>Ici on parle fran&ccedil;ais</i>."</p>

<p>"I don't believe anybody talks French in that dump," one of the
observers remarked.</p>

<p>To settle the matter, they entered, and ordered ginger ale of a
red-headed barkeeper who was unmistakably Irish.</p>

<p>One of the men addressed the barkeeper:</p>

<p>"<i>Fait beau temps, monsieur</i>."</p>

<p>The barkeeper scowled.</p>

<p>"Come agin!" he demanded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p><p>It was soon demonstrated that French was a language unknown to the
establishment.</p>

<p>The visitor then inquired as to the reason for the sign in the window,
explaining that it meant, "French is spoken here."</p>

<p>The Irish barkeeper cursed heartily.</p>

<p>"I bought it off a sheeny," he explained, "for six bits. He tould me it
was Latin for, 'God Bless Our Home.'"</p>

<p>The optimistic pessimist explained why he always dined in restaurants

<p>The young man, who was interested in natural history, was sitting on the
porch one June evening with his best girl, who was interested in music.
The rhythmic shrilling of the insects pulsed on the air, and from the
village church down the street came the sounds of choir practise. The
young man gave his attention to the former, the girl to the latter; and
presently she spoke eagerly:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't it sound grand!"</p>

<p>The young man nodded, and answered:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p><p>"Yes, indeed! and it's interesting to think that they do it all with

<p>The boy violinist, played at a private musical, rendering a difficult
concerto, which contained some particularly long rests for the soloist:
During one of these intervals, a kindly dowager leaned toward the
performer, and whispered loudly:</p>

<p>"Why don't you play something that you know, my boy?"</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The apoplectic and grumpy old gentleman in the crowded restaurant was
compelled to sit, much against his will, next to the orchestra. His
stare at the leader as the jazz selection came to an end. The annoyed
patron snorted, and then asked:</p>

<p>"Would you be so kind as to play something by request?"</p>

<p>The leader bowed again and beamed.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied; "anything you like, sir."</p>

<p>"Then," snapped the patron, "please be good enough to play a game of
checkers while I finish my meal."</p>

<h3 class="left">NEATNESS</h3>

<p>The Japanese are remarkably tidy in the matter of floors. They even

continually distressed by the dirty hallways of the building in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>

<p>The older sister rebuked the younger when putting her to bed for being

<p>"I dream that I'm married."</p>

<p>"Ah, hum!" the physician grunted perfunctorily. "To whom?"</p>

<p>"To my wife," the patient explained. "That's what makes it a

<h3 class="left">NOMENCLATURE</h3>

<p>The young son of a mountaineer family in North Carolina had visited for
the first time in the town twelve miles from home, and had eaten his
mid-day meal there. Questioned on his return as to the repast, he
described it with enthusiasm, except in one particular:</p>

<p>"They done had something they called gravee. But hit looked like sop,
an' hit tasted like sop, an' I believe in my soul 'twar sop!"</p>

<p>When his daughter returned from the girls' college, the farmer regarded
her critically, and then demanded:</p>

<p>"Ain't you a lot fatter than you was?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dad," the girl admitted. "I weigh one hundred and forty pounds
stripped for 'gym.'"</p>

society was prevented by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> illness from introducing the speaker, and the
mayor, who was more popular than learned, was asked to officiate. The
amiable gentleman introduced the stranger with his accustomed eloquence,
and concluded a few happy remarks of a general character with this
observation:</p>

<p>During the scarcity of labor, a new clerk, who knew nothing of the
business, was taken on by a furniture house. His mistakes were so bad
that the proprietor was compelled to watch him closely, and to fire him
after the following episode.</p>

<p>A lady customer asked to see some chiffoniers. The clerk led her to the
display of bassinettes, which was an unfortunate error since the lady
was an old maid. She accepted his apology, however, and then remarked:</p>

<p>"Where are your sideboards?"</p>

<p>The clerk blushed furiously, as he replied:</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;I shaved them off last week."</p>

everything was perfectly quiet. And then, when he woke up, all of a

<h3 class="left">OBSTINACY</h3>

<p>The old mountaineer and his wife arrived at a railway station, and for
the first time in their lives beheld a train of cars, which was standing
there. The husband looked the engine over very carefully, and shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of it, father?" asked the old lady.</p>

<p>"She'll never start," was the firm answer: "she'll never start."</p>

<p>The conductor waved, the bell rang, the locomotive puffed, the train
moved slowly at first, then faster. It was disappearing in the distance
when the wife inquired slyly:</p>

<p>"Well, pa, what do you think of it now?"</p>

<p>The old man shook his head more violently than before.</p>

<p>"She'll never stop," he asserted; "she'll never stop!"</p>

surprised.</p>

<p>"No, you ain't," the sergeant snapped. "And I want to know the reason
why."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I guess it must be this way," Jenkins suggested. "There was

<h3 class="left">OPTIMISM</h3>

<p>The day laborer was of a cheerful disposition that naturally inclined to
seek out the good in every situation. He was a genuine optimist. Thus,
after tramping the three miles from home to begin the day's work on the
ditch, he discovered that he had been careless, and explained to a
fellow laborer:</p>

<p>"I've gone and done it now! I left my lunch at home."</p>

<p>Then, suddenly he beamed happily, as he added:</p>

<p>"And it's a good thing I did, for the matter of that, because I left my
teeth at home, too."</p>

<h3 class="left">ORIENTATION</h3>

<p>John B. Gough was fond of telling of a laird and his servant Sandy. The
two were on their way home on horseback late at night, and both were
much muddled by drink. At a ford where the bank was steep, the laird
fell head first into the creek. He scrambled up, and shouted to his
servant:</p>

<p>"Hold on, Sandy! Something fell off&mdash;I heard it splash!"</p>

<p>Sandy climbed down from the saddle, and waded about blindly in the
shallow water, with groping hands. At last, he seized on the laird.</p>

<p>"Why, it's yerself, mon, as fell oof!"</p>

<p>"No, Sandy," the master declared stoutly. "It can't be me&mdash;here I am."
Then he, added: "But if it is me, get me back on the horse."</p>

<p>Sandy helped the laird to the horse, and boosted him up astride. In the
dark, the rider was faced the wrong way to.</p>

<p>"Gie me the reins," the master ordered.</p>

<p>Sandy felt about the horse's rump, and, then cried out, clutching the
tail:</p>

<p>"It waur the horse's head as fell off&mdash;nothin' left but the mane!"</p>

<p>"Gie me the mane, then," the laird directed stolidly. "I must een hae
something to hold on."</p>

<p>So, presently, when he had the tail firmly grasped in both hands, and
Sandy had mounted, the procession began to move. Whereat, the laird
shouted in dismay:</p>

<p>"Haud on, Sandy! It's gaein' the wrang way!"</p>

<p>He answered proudly, even enthusiastically, without any hesitation:</p>

<p>"George Washington, first in war, first in peace, first in the

into the muck, from which he emerged in a dreadful state, though
uninjured except in his feelings. The general himself, who had witnessed
the incident, rode up, and preserving his gravity with some effort
inquired of the trooper if he had suffered any hurt from the fall.</p>

<p>"Here it is Monday morning and to-morrow will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> Tuesday, and the next
day Wednesday&mdash;the whole week half gone, and nothing done yit!"</p>

<p>The old man shook his head dolefully in response to an inquiry
concerning his health.</p>

<p>"It isn't what it ought to be," he declared. "I find my strength is
failing. It used to be I could walk around the block every morning. But
now lately, somehow, when I'm only half way round, I feel so tired I
have to turn and come back."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The visitor remarked affably to the man of the house:</p>

<p>"Your family is wonderfully talented. One son plays the cornet, two
daughters play the piano and the guitar, and your wife plays the banjo,
and the other children play ukuleles. As the father of such musical
geniuses, you must be something yourself, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer, "I am a pessimist."</p>

<p>"I hear that Mrs. Brewster hasn't paid her servants any wages for a
number of months," remarked one lady to another in a suburban town.</p>

<p>"Why does she keep such a number of them then?" was the pertinent
inquiry.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Brewster tells everyone she regards it as her solemn duty to
employ as many as possible when times are so hard."</p>

<p>Little Willie questioned his grandmother with an appearance of great
seriousness:</p>

<p>"Ain't Rotterdam the name of a city, Gramma?"</p>

<p>"Don't say 'ain't', Willie," the old lady corrected. "Yes, Rotterdam is
the name of a city. Why?"</p>

<p>"It ain't swearin' to say it, is it Gramma?"</p>

<p>"Don't say 'ain't', Willie. No, it isn't swearing to say Rotterdam.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Cause if sister keeps on eatin' so much candy, she'll Rotterdam head
off."</p>

<h3 class="left">PHYSIOLOGY</h3>

<p>The teacher explained to her young pupils some facts concerning various
organs of the body, including the eye as the organ of sight, the ear as
the organ of hearing, and the like. Then she asked the pupils to repeat
to her what they had learned. There was a short silence, which was
broken by a bright little boy, who spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"I see with my eye organ, I hear with my ear organ, I smell with my nose
organ, I eat with my mouth organ, and I feel with my hand organ."</p>

<h3 class="left">PLAIN SPEAKING</h3>

<p>The new maid was talkative, and related some of her experiences in
service.</p>

<p>"You seem to have had a good many situations," was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> the lady's comment
as the girl paused. "How many different mistresses have you had, all
told?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen, all told," the maid declared promptly; "yes mum, all told
eggzactly what I thought of them."</p>

<h3 class="left">PLAYING POSSUM</h3>

<p>"No, suh," the ancient negro asserted, with a melancholy shaking of his
bald head, "dar hain't no trustin' a 'possum. Once on a time, suh, I
done watched de hole of a 'possum all night long. An' at las', suh, de
'possum done come out of his hole. An' what yoh t'ink de ole scallywog

<h3 class="left">PLUMBER</h3>

<p>The plumber at many dollars a day could afford a little persiflage with
the cook in the kitchen where he was theoretically repairing the sink.
The cook was plain-featured, but any diversion was welcome to speed the
hours for which he drew pay. He made a strong impression on the cook,
and when he took his departure, she simpered, and said coyly:</p>

<p>"Thursday is my evenin' off, an' we might go to the movies."</p>

<p>The plumber snorted indignantly.</p>

<p>"What!" he demanded. "On me own time?"</p>

<h3 class="left">POETRY</h3>

<p>The evil effects of decadent verse is unintentionally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> told in the
following extract from a Hindu's letter to the authorities requesting
aid in behalf of his invalid father, who leads sickly life, and is going
from bad to perhaps, but not too well; for an extract from the petition
calls on the government "to look after my old faher, who leads sickly
life, and is going from bad to verse every day."</p>

<h3 class="left">POINT OF VIEW</h3>

<p>A couple from Boston spent a winter in Augusta, Georgia. During the
period of their visit, they became fond of an old colored woman, and
even invited her to visit their home at their expense. In due time after
their return to Boston, the visitor was entertained. Every courtesy was
extended to the old colored woman, and she even had her meals with the
host and hostess. One day at dinner, the host remarked, with a certain
smug satisfaction in his own democratic hospitality:</p>

<p>"I imagine that, during all the time you were a slave, your master never
invited you to eat at his table."</p>

<p>"No, suh, dat he didn't," replied the old darky. "My master was a
genl'man. He never let no nigger set at table 'long side o' him."</p>

<p>The kindly old lady chanced to be present at the feeding of the lions in
the zoo. Presently, she remarked to the keeper:</p>

<p>"Isn't that a very small piece of meat to give to the lions?"</p>

<p>The man answered very respectfully, but firmly:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p><p>"It may seem like a very small piece of meat to you, mum, but it seems

<p>Tommy Atkins and a doughboy sat in a poker game together somewhere in
France. The Britisher held a full house, the American four of a kind.</p>

<p>The Yankee did not hesitate.</p>

<p>"I ain't exactly onto your currency curves, but I'll bump it up four
tons."</p>

<h3 class="left">POLITENESS</h3>

<p>The little girl in the car was a pest. She crossed the aisle to devote
herself to a dignified fat man, to his great annoyance. She asked
innumerable questions, and, incidentally, counted aloud his vest buttons
to learn whether he was rich man, poor man, beggar man or thief. The
mother regarded the child's efforts as highly entertaining. The fat man
leaned forward and addressed the lady very courteously:</p>

<p>"Madam, what do you call this dear little child?"</p>

<p>"Ethel," the beaming mother replied.</p>

<p>"Please call her then," the fat man requested.</p>

<p>Johnny, who was to be the guest at a neighbor's for the noonday meal,
was carefully admonished by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> mother to remember his manners, and to
speak in complimentary terms of the food served him. He heeded the
instruction, and did the best he could under stress of embarrassment.</p>

<p>After he had tasted the soup, he remarked as boldly as he could
contrive:</p>

<p>"This is pretty good soup&mdash;what there is of it."</p>

<p>He was greatly disconcerted to observe that his remark caused a frown on
the face of his hostess. He hastened to speak again in an effort to
correct any bad impression from his previous speech:</p>

<p>"And there's plenty of it&mdash;such as it is."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>On Johnnie's return from the birthday party, his mother expressed the
hope that he had behaved politely at the luncheon table, and properly
said, "Yes, if you please" and "No, thank you," when anything was
offered him.</p>

<p>Johnnie shook his head seriously.</p>

<p>"I guess I didn't say, 'No, thank you.' I ate everything there was."</p>

<p>The teacher used as an illustration of bad grammar, for correction by
the class, the following sentence:</p>

<p>"The horse and cow is in the pasture."</p>

<p>A manly little fellow raised his hand, and at the teacher's nod said:</p>

Still Club."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," the woman replied. "And please excuse my staring&mdash;I
belong to the Stand and Stare Club."</p>

<p>She proved it so well that the man at last sheepishly got to his feet.</p>

<p>"I guess, ma'am," he mumbled, "I'll resign from my club and join yours."</p>

<h3 class="left">POLITICS</h3>

<p>The little boy interrupted his father's reading of the paper with a
petition.</p>

<p>"Please, Daddy, tell me the story about the Forty Thieves."</p>

<p>The father, aroused from his absorption in political news and comment on
the campaign, regarded his son thoughtfully for a moment, and then shook
his head.</p>

<p>"No," he answered decisively, "you must wait until you're a little
older, my son. You're too young to understand politics."</p>

<h3 class="left">POPULATION</h3>

<p>Someone asked a darky from Richmond who was visiting in the North as to
the population of the city.</p>

<h3 class="left">POSTAL</h3>

<p>It is human nature to take an interest in the affairs of others. The
fact has been amply demonstrated by innumerable postmasters and
postmistresses who have profited from their contact with the
communities' correspondence. That the postman, too, is likely to be well
informed is shown in a quotation by <i>Punch</i> of a local letter-carrier's
apology to a lady on his round:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Ma'am, I seem to have lost your postcard; but it only said
Muriel thanked you for the parcel and so did John, and they were both
very well, and the children are happy, and she'll give your message to
Margery. That'll be your other daughter, I'm thinkin'?"</p>

<h3 class="left">PRAYER</h3>

<p>The Dutchman still retained a strong accent, although he had been in the
country forty years, and was a churchwarden. When the rector complained
that a certain parishioner had called him a perfect ass, and asked
advice, the reply, though well intentioned, sounded ambiguous:</p>

<p>"All you should do vill pe youst to bray for him, as usual."</p>

<p>A Scotch missionary in the Far East suffered ill fortune in his
marriages, for two wives in succession yielded to the trying climate and
died. The missionary had depended on the Board at home to select his
previous mates, and he wrote for a third. When due time had elapsed, he
journeyed to the seaport to meet the steamer by which his new mate
should arrive. At the appointed hour, as the boat drew in, he stood on
the dock anxiously waiting. Among the few passengers to descend the
gangplank, it was easy for him to select the one destined for him. At
sight of her, he shuddered slightly, and a groan burst from his lips.</p>

<p>"Freckles," he muttered despairingly, "and red headed, and with
squint&mdash;for the third time!&mdash;and after all my prayers!"</p>

<p>Charles had attained the age of five when he attended a football game
for the first time. It cannot be doubted that he was profoundly
impressed by the excitement on the gridiron, for at bedtime his mother

it with?"</p>

little girl, scarcely more than a baby, knelt at her mother's knee.</p>

<p>The eyes, which all day long are alight with mischief, were reverently
closed, and as she haltingly uttered the words of the old, yet ever
young child's prayer her rapt face, raised occasionally from her dimpled
hands, took on an expression almost seraphic in its innocent purity.</p>

<p>With a fervent "Amen" she ended her supplication, then jumped up, eyes
dancing, and exclaimed:</p>

prayer, he explained that he always repeated it when the others in the

added further:</p>

<p>"I just say the little prayer mother taught me&mdash;'Now I lay me down to

<p>A prayer showing a ghastly confusion of metaphors is on record as having
been offered extemporaneously in behalf of Queen Adelaide during the
reign of that sovereign. The words as quoted were these:</p>

<p>"O Lord, save thy servant, our Sovereign Lady, the Queen. Grant that as
she grows an old woman, she may become a new man. Strengthen her with
Thy blessing that she may live a pure virgin, bringing her sons and
daughters to the glory of God. And give her grace that she may go before
her people like a he-goat upon the mountains."</p>

<p>One man spoke confidently in answer:</p>

<p>A colored deacon who was the leader in a congregation down South, wrote
to the bishop to explain the need of a minister for the church. He
concluded his appeal as follows:</p>

<p>"Send us a Bishop to preach. If you can't send us a Bishop, send us a
Sliding Elder. If you can't send a Sliding Elder, send us a Stationary
Preacher. If you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> can't spare him, send us a Circus Eider. If you can't

Zeb shuffled out of sight, and after a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> lapse of half an hour, shuffled

called for the number of his own home in the suburbs. When the
connection was made, he called into the transmitter:</p>

<p>"Maria!" and after a pause, "Maria!" and again "Maria!" There followed a
few seconds of waiting, and he repeated his call in a peremptory tone,
"Maria!"</p>

<p>The electric storm that had been gathering broke at this moment. A bolt
of lightning hit the telephone wires. The gentleman was hurled violently
under his desk. Presently, he crawled forth in a dazed condition, and
regarded the repair man plaintively.</p>

violence was permitted by a very scanty breath:</p>

<p>"Here, hold on! What are you gittin' at? I ain't a-goin' to snuff out!"</p>

<h3 class="left">REWARD OF MERIT</h3>

<p>A very tidy young man was distressed by his wife's carelessness in
attire at home. He was especially annoyed by a torn skirt, which his
wife was forever pinning and never mending. Being a tidy man, he had
acquired some skill with a needle in his bachelor days. With the
intention of administering a rebuke to his wife, he set to work on the
skirt during her absence and sewed it up neatly. When, on her return
home, he showed her what he had done, she was touched and kissed him
tenderly. Soon she left the room, to return with an armful of garments.</p>

<p>"Here are some more for you, darling," she announced happily. "Don't

daughter because he had not money enough to buy any furniture.</p>

<p>"A wicked man offered to give the young man twenty-five dollars if he
would become a drunkard. The young man wanted the money very much, so he
could marry the rich candy lady's daughter, but when he got to the
saloon he turned to the wicked man and said, 'I will not become a
drunkard even for twenty-five dollars. Get from behind me, Satan.'</p>

<p>"On his way home he found a pocketbook containing a million dollars in
gold. Then the young lady consented to marry him. They had a beautiful
wedding, and the next day they had twins. Thus you see that Virtue has
its own reward."</p>

loudly. He protested against the base trickery of his two companions on
the trip.</p>

<p>"It was agreed," he explained, "before we started, that the one who
caught the first fish must stand treat to a supper. Now, you'd hardly
believe it, but it's a fact that when we got to fishing, both those
fellows deliberately refused to pull in their lines when they had bites,
just so I'd be stuck."</p>

<p>"That was a mean trick," one of the auditors asserted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> sympathetically.
"How much did the supper cost you?"</p>

<p>The grouchy fisherman relaxed slightly.</p>

cowardice, darted to the spot, and with a threatening gesture of his

<h3 class="left">SANITY</h3>

<p>It is a matter of uncommon knowledge that personal perfection is a most
trying thing to live with. In the United States recently, a woman sued
for divorce, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>alleging in the complaint against her husband that he had
no faults. It was probably a subtle subconscious realization of the
unpleasantness, even the unendurableness, of perfection in the domestic
companionship that caused the obvious misprint in the following extract
from a Scotch editorial concerning the new divorce legislation:</p>

<p>"But the Bill creates new grounds for the dissolution of the marriage
bond, which are unknown to the law of Scotland. Cruelty, incurable
sanity, or habitual drunkenness are proposed as separate grounds of
divorce."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The ponderous judge interrupted the eloquent lawyer harshly:</p>

<p>"All you say goes in at one ear and out at the other."</p>

<p>"What is to prevent it?" was the retort.</p>

<h3 class="left">SAVING</h3>

<p>A servant, who indulged in sprees during which he spent all his money,
was advised by his master to save<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> against a rainy day. A week later,
the master inquired if any saving had been accomplished.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed, sir," the servant responded. "But, you see, sir, it
rained yesterday, and it all went."</p>

<h3 class="left">SCHEDULE</h3>

<p>Cooks' tourists travel exactly according to schedule. The following
conversation was overheard in Rome between a mother and daughter:</p>

<p>"Is this Rome, ma?"</p>

<p>"What day of the week is it, Matilda?"</p>

<p>"Tuesday. What of it?"</p>

<p>"If it's Tuesday, it must be Rome."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The man about to take a train was worried by the station clocks. There
was twenty minutes difference between the one in the office and the one
in the waiting-room. Finally, he questioned a porter. That worthy made a
careful survey of the two clocks, and shook his head doubtfully. Then,
he brightened suddenly, and said:</p>

<p>"It don't make a single mite of difference about the clocks. The train
goes at four-ten, no matter what."</p>

<h3 class="left">SEASICKNESS</h3>

<p>On the first morning of the voyage, the vessel ran into a nasty choppy
sea, which steadily grew worse. There were twenty-five passengers at the
captain's table for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> dinner, and he addressed them in an amiable
welcoming speech:</p>

<p>"I hope that all twenty-five of you will have a pleasant trip." The soup
appeared, and he continued: "I sincerely hope that this little assembly
of twenty-four will thoroughly enjoy the voyage. I look upon these
twenty-two smiling faces as a father upon his family, for I am
responsible for the safety of this group of seventeen. And now I ask
that all fourteen of you join me in drinking to a merry trip. Indeed, I
believe that we eight are most congenial, and I applaud the good fortune
that brought these three persons to my table. You and I, my dear sir,
are&mdash;&mdash; Here, steward, clear away all those dishes, and bring me the
fish."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The pair on their honeymoon were crossing the Channel, and the movement
of the waves seemed to be going on right inside the bride. In a fleeting
moment of internal calm she murmured pathetically to the bridegroom in
whose arms she was clasped:</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, do you love me?"</p>

<p>"My darling!" he affirmed. "You know I love you with all my heart and
soul&mdash;I worship you, I adore you, my precious oontsy-woontsy!"</p>

<p>The boat reeled, and a sickening pang thrilled through all the
foundations of the bride's being.</p>

<p>"O dear, O dear!" she gasped. "I hoped that might help a little, but it
didn't&mdash;not a bit!"</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The seasick voyager on the ocean bowed humbly over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> the rail and made
libation to Neptune. The kindly old gentleman who stood near remarked
sympathetically:</p>

<p>"You have a weak stomach."</p>

<p>The victim paused in his distressing occupation to snort indignantly:</p>

<p>"Weak? Humph! I guess I can throw as far as anybody on this ship."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The wife of the seasick passenger was about to leave the stateroom for
dinner. She inquired of her husband solicitously:</p>

<p>"George, shall I have the steward bring some dinner to you here?"</p>

<p>"No," was the reply, haltingly given between groans.</p>

<p>"But I wish, my dear, you would ask him to take it on deck and throw it
over the rail for me."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The moralizing gentleman at the club remarked ponderously:</p>

<p>"If there is anything in a man, travel will bring it out."</p>

<p>One who had just landed from a rough crossing agreed bitterly:</p>

<p>"Especially ocean travel."</p>

<h3 class="left">SECTARIAN</h3>

<p>Once upon a time a coach was held up by a road-agent. The driver
explained to the robber that his only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> passenger was a man, who was
asleep inside. The highwayman insisted that the traveler be awakened. "I
want to go through his pockets!" he declared fiercely, with an oath.</p>

<p>The bishop, when aroused, made gentle protests.</p>

<p>"You surely would not rob a poor bishop!" he exclaimed. "I have no money
worth your attention, and I am engaged on my duties as a bishop."</p>

<p>The robber hesitated.</p>

<p>"A bishop, eh?" he said thoughtfully. "Of what church?"</p>

<p>"The Episcopal."</p>

<p>"The hell you are! That's the church I belong to! So long!... Driver,
larrup them mules!"</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>A Scotch Presbyterian clergyman tells the story of a parishioner who
formed a secession with a few others unable to accept the doctrines of
the church. But when the clergyman asked this man if he and the others
worshiped together, the answer was:</p>

<p>"No. The fact is, I found that they accepted certain points to which I
could not agree, so I withdrew from communion with them."</p>

<p>"So, then," the clergyman continued, "I suppose you and your wife carry
on your devotions together at home."</p>

<p>"No, not exactly," the man admitted. "I found that our views on certain
doctrines are not in harmony. So, there has been a division between us.
Now, she worships in the northeast corner of the room and I in the
southwest."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">SELF-BETRAYAL</h3>

<p>The old lady was very aristocratic, but somewhat prim and precise.
Nevertheless, when the company had been telling of college pranks, she
relaxed slightly, and told of a lark that had caused excitement in
Cambridge when she was a girl there. This was to the effect that two
maidens of social standing were smuggled into the second-story room of a
Harvard student for a gay supper. The affair was wholly innocent, but
secrecy was imperative, to avoid scandal. The meal was hardly begun when
a thunderous knock of authority came on the door. The young men acted
swiftly in the emergency. Silently, one of the girls was lowered to the
ground from the window by a rope knotted under her arms. The second girl
was then lowered, but the rope broke when the descent was hardly half
completed.</p>

<p>The old lady had related the incident with increasing animation, and at
this critical point in the narrative she burst forth:</p>

<p>"And I declare, when that rope broke, I just knew I was going to be
killed, sure!"</p>

<h3 class="left">SERMON</h3>

<p>The aged colored clergyman, who made up in enthusiasm what he lacked in
education, preached a sermon on the verse of the Psalm, "Awake, Psaltery
and Harp! I myself will awake right early." The explanation of the
words, which preceded the exhortation, was as follows:</p>

<p>"Awake, Peasel Tree an' Ha'ap, I myself will awake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> airly. Dis yere Sam
was wrote by de prophet Moses. Moses was mighty fond o' playin' on de
ha'ap all de day long, an' at night when he went to bed he'd hang up de
ha'ap on de limb ob a Peasel tree what grew on de outside o' de window,
an' in de mawnin', when de sun would get up an' shine in his face, he'd
jump out o' bed, an' exclaim, 'Wake, Peasel Tree an' Ha'ap! I myself
will awake airly!'"</p>

<h3 class="left">SCAPEGOAT</h3>

<p>Cousin Willie, aged ten, came for a visit to Johnnie, aged twelve.
Johnnie's mother directed him to take the visitor out to play with his
boy friends in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>"And be sure to have lots of fun," she added.</p>

<p>On the return of the boys, Willie, the guest, appeared somewhat
downcast, but Johnnie was radiant.</p>

<p>"Did you have a good time?" his mother asked.</p>

<p>"Bully!" Johnnie answered.</p>

<p>"And lots of fun?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>"But Willie doesn't look very happy," Johnnie's mother said doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," Johnnie answered, beaming, "the rest of us, we had our
fun with Willie."</p>

<h3 class="left">SHEEP AND GOATS</h3>

<p>The little girl was deeply impressed by the clergyman's sermon as to the
separation of the sheep and the goats. That night after she had gone to
bed, she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> heard sobbing, and the mother went to her, to ask what was
the matter.</p>

<p>"It's about the goats!" Jenny confessed at last. "I'm so afraid I am a
goat, and so I'll never go to heaven. Oh, I'm so afraid I'm a goat!"</p>

<p>"My dear," the mother assured her weeping child. "You're a sweet little
lamb. If you were to die to-night, you would go straight to heaven." Her
words were successful in quieting the little girl, and she slept.</p>

<p>But the following night Jenny was found crying again in her bed, and
when her mother appeared she wailed:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid about the goats."</p>

<p>"But mother has told you that you are a little lamb, and that you must
never worry over being a goat."</p>

<p>Jenny, however, was by no means comforted, and continued her sobs.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma," she declared sadly, "I know that. But I'm afraid&mdash;awful
afraid you're a goat!"</p>

<h3 class="left">SHIFTLESSNESS</h3>

<p>The shiftless man, who preferred reading to labor, closed the book on
French history, which he had been perusing with great interest, and
addressed his wife.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mary," he asked impressively, "what I would have done if I
had been in Napoleon's place?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" the wife snapped. "You'd have settled right down on a farm
in Corsica, and let it run itself."</p>

<h3 class="left">SHIPWRECK</h3>

<p>The new member of the club listened with solemn interest to the various
stories that were told in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>smoking room. They were good stories, and
obviously lies, and each of them was a bigger lie than any that had gone
before. Finally, the company insisted that the new member should relate
a tale. He refused at first, but under pressure yielded, and gave a
vivid account of a shipwreck at sea during one of his voyages. He
described the stress of the terrible situation with such power that his
hearers were deeply impressed. He reached the point in his account where
only the captain and himself and half a dozen others were left aboard
the doomed vessel, after the last of the boats had been lowered.</p>

<p>"And then," he concluded, "a vast wave came hurtling down on us. It was
so huge that it shut out all the sky. It crashed over the already
sinking ship in a torrent of irresistible force. Under that dreadful
blow the laboring vessel sank, and all those left on board of her were
drowned."</p>

<p>The narrator paused and there was a period of tense silence. But
presently someone asked:</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;what became of you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I," was the reply, "why I was drowned with the rest of them."</p>

<h3 class="left">SLANDER</h3>

<p>The business man's wife, who had called at his office, regarded the
pretty young stenographer with a baleful eye.</p>

<p>"You told me that your typewriter was an old maid," she accused.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p><p>The husband, at a loss, faltered in his reply, but at last contrived:</p>

<p>"Yes, but she's sick to-day, and sent her grandchild in her place."</p>

<h3 class="left">SLAVERY</h3>

<p>A traveler in the South chatted with an aged negro, whom he met in the
road.</p>

<p>"And I suppose you were once a slave?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, suh," the old colored man answered.</p>

<p>"And, so, after the war, you gained your freedom," the gentleman
continued.</p>

<p>But the ancient one shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"No, suh," he declared with great emphasis. "Not perzactly, suh. I
didn't git mah freedom, suh, after de war&mdash;I done got married!"</p>

<h3 class="left">SMELLS</h3>

<p>An argument arose among a number of British officers during their time
of service in the Dardanelles, and wagers were made among them. The
question at issue was as to which smells the louder, a goat or a Turk.
The colonel was made arbiter. He sat judicially in his tent, and a goat
was brought in. The colonel fainted. After the officer had been revived,
and was deemed able to continue his duty as referee, a Turk was brought
into the tent. The goat fainted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">SOCIAL UPLIFT</h3>

<p>The somewhat unpleasant person, who was a social worker, completed her
call on a dweller in the tenement district, and rose to depart. The
unwilling hostess shook her head at the visitor's promise to come again.</p>

<p>"And excuse me if I don't return the call," she vouchsafed. "Myself,
I've got no time to go slummin'."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The philanthropic hostess entertained a party of children from the slums
at her home. She addressed one particularly pretty and
intelligent-looking little girl, who listened shyly. She urged the child
to speak without embarrassment. The little one complied, aspiring:</p>

<p>"How many children have you?"</p>

<p>"Six," the hostess answered, in surprise.</p>

<p>"What a big family! You must be sure to look after them properly, and be
very careful to keep them clean."</p>

<p>"I'll try to, certainly," the lady declared, much amused.</p>

<p>"Has your husband got a job?" the girl demanded crisply.</p>

<p>"Well, no," the hostess admitted.</p>

<p>"How unfortunate! You know you must keep out of debt."</p>

<p>"Really, you must not be impertinent," was the reproof.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," the child responded simply, "mother said I must talk like a
lady, and that's the way the ladies talk when they come to see us."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">SPANKING</h3>

<p>Back in those days when corporal punishment was permitted to teachers, a
minor teacher named Miss Bings complained to one of her superiors, Miss
Manners, that she had spanked one particular boy, Thomas, until she
could spank him no more for physical fatigue.</p>

<p>"When you want him spanked again, send him to me," Miss Manners said.</p>

<p>Next morning, Thomas came into the presence of Miss Manners, displaying
an air that was downcast. The teacher regarded him with suspicion.</p>

<p>"Did you come from Miss Bings?" she asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," Thomas admitted.</p>

<p>"I thought as much!" On the instant, she skillfully inverted the
youngster over her lap, and whacked him in a most spirited manner. This
duty done, as the wailings of the boy died away, she demanded sternly:</p>

<p>"And now what have you to say?"</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am," Thomas answered brokenly, "Miss Bings wants the
scissors!"</p>

<h3 class="left">SPEED</h3>

<p>In the business college, the instructor addressed the new class
concerning the merits of shorthand. In his remarks, he included this
statement:</p>

<p>"It is a matter of record that it took the poet Gray seven years to
write his famous poem, 'Elegy in a Country Churchyard.' Had he been
proficient in stenography, he could have done it in seven minutes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> We
have had students who have written it in that length of time."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The young lady interested in botany inquired of the gentleman who had
been traveling in the South.</p>

<p>"What sort of a plant is the Virginia creeper?"</p>

<p>"That is not a plant," was the answer, given wearily; "it's a railroad."</p>

<h3 class="left">SPELLING</h3>

<p>Some time before Mr. Taft became President of the United States, he took
an extended trip in the mountains of West Virginia. On one occasion, he
was conveyed along the mountain roads in a buggy driven by a native of
the region. As they came to a small stream, Mr. Taft, without any
particular interest, inquired concerning the brook's name. So far as he
could understand, the answer was:</p>

<p>"This here are Swum-swum Crick."</p>

<p>"What?" Mr. Taft demanded.</p>

<p>In the repetition, the words sounded like:</p>

<p>"This here are Swoovel Crick."</p>

<p>The questioner was so puzzled that he asked the mountaineer how the name
of the Creek was spelled.</p>

<p>The native spat tobacco juice reflectively over the wheel, and then
spoke judicially:</p>

<p>"Waal, some spells it one way, an' some spells it another way; but in my
jedgmint thar are no propeer way."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The clerk of the court directed the witness to spell his name. The man
started his reply thus:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p><p>"<i>O</i> double <i>t</i>, <i>i</i> double <i>u</i>, <i>e</i> double <i>l</i>, double <i>u</i>, double&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The clerk interrupted:</p>

<p>"Please, begin again."</p>

<p>The witness complied glibly:</p>

<p>"<i>O</i> double <i>t</i>, <i>i</i> double <i>u</i>, <i>e</i> double <i>l</i>, double <i>u</i>, double
<i>o</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The clerk groaned. The judge himself intervened: "What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Your Honor, it is Ottiwell Wood. I spell it: <i>O</i> double <i>t</i>, <i>i</i> double
<i>u</i>, <i>e</i> double <i>l</i>, double <i>u</i>, double <i>o</i>, <i>d</i>."</p>

<h3 class="left">SPINSTERHOOD</h3>

<p>The old colored mammy took advantage of a wedding announcement to
question her mistress, who remained a spinster still though approaching
middle age.</p>

<p>"When is you gwine to git married, missy?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, mammy," was the thoughtful reply. "Really, I don't think
I'll ever get married."</p>

<p>A note of sadness in the speaker's voice moved the old woman to attempt
philosophical consolation:</p>

<p>"Well, they do say as how ole maids am the happies' kind after they
quits strugglin'."</p>

<h3 class="left">SPITE</h3>

<p>The faithful old employee asked for a day off. The request was granted,
with an inquiry as to what he intended to do on his holiday.</p>

<p>"I think," came the cautious answer, "I shall go to my wife's funeral.
She died the other day."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p><p>A few weeks later, the request for a day off was repeated.</p>

<p>"And what are you going to do this time?" the employer asked.</p>

<p>"I think, mebbe, I'll get married."</p>

<p>"What! So soon after burying your wife?"</p>

<p>The faithful old employee smiled tolerantly, as he answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I was never one to hold spite."</p>

<h3 class="left">SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>

<p>In the party out after reed birds was a tyro at the sport. When at last
he saw one of the birds walking about, he plumped down on his stomach,
and took aim. A companion called to him sharply:</p>

<p>"You're not going to shoot the bird while it's walking?"</p>

<p>"No," was the firm response; "I'll wait till it stops."</p>

<h3 class="left">SPRING</h3>

<p>The teacher talked on the four seasons, telling how in the spring the
new life comes to the earth, with the growth of grasses and leaves and
flowers, how this life matures in summer, and so on, and so on. Then she
called on the class to repeat the information she had given. She asked
one little boy about spring.</p>

<p>"What do we find in the spring, George?"</p>

<p>George seemed very reluctant to answer, but when the teacher insisted he
at last said:</p>

<p>"Why, ma'am, there's a frog, an' a lizard, an' a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> snake, an' a dead cat,
but I didn't put the cat there. It was another boy."</p>

<h3 class="left">STAMMERING</h3>

<p>On the occasion of a most interesting family event, Mr. Peedle, who
desired a son, paced the drawing-room in extreme agitation, until at
last the doctor appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, tell me," he gasped, "what is it&mdash;a boy or a girl?"</p>

<p>"Tr-tr-tr&mdash;" the physician began stammeringly.</p>

<p>Peedle paled.</p>

<p>"Triplets! Merciful providence!"</p>

<p>"Qu-qu-qu&mdash;" spluttered the doctor.</p>

<p>Peedle paled some more.</p>

<p>"Quadruplets!" he moaned.</p>

<p>"N-n-no!" the physician snapped. "Qu-qu-quite the contrary. Tr-tr-try to
take it qu-quietly. It's a girl."</p>

<h3 class="left">STYLE</h3>

<p>Two old friends met, and immediately found that they were equally
devoted to motoring. After a discussion of their various cars, one
bethought himself to ask concerning the other's wife, whom he had never
seen. That lady was described by her husband, as follows:</p>

<p>"Nineteen-six model, limousine so to say, heavy tread, runs on low."</p>

<p>"Self-starter?"</p>

<p>"You bet!"</p>

<h3 class="left">SUNDAY SCHOOL</h3>

<p>The young lady worker for the Sunday school called on the newly wedded
pair.</p>

<p>"I am endeavoring to secure new scholars," she explained. "Won't you
send your children?"</p>

<p>When she was informed that there were no children in the family as yet,
she continued brightly:</p>

<p>"But won't you please send them when you do have them?"</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The Sunday-school teacher examined his new class.</p>

<p>"Who made the world?" he demanded. Nobody seemed to know. He repeated
the question somewhat sternly. As the silence persisted, he frowned and
spoke with increased severity:</p>

<p>"Children, I must know who made the world!"</p>

<p>Then, at last, a small boy piped up in much agitation:</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, please, sir, it wasn't me!"</p>

<h3 class="left">SUPERMAN</h3>

<p>It is told of Mrs. Gladstone that a number of ladies in her drawing-room
once became engaged in earnest discussion of a difficult problem. It
chanced that at the time the great prime minister was in his study
upstairs. As the argument in the drawing-room became hopelessly
involved, a devout lady of the company took advantage of a lull to say:</p>

<p>"Ah, well, there is One above Who knows it all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gladstone beamed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p><p>"Yes," she said proudly. "And William will be down directly to tell us

<h3 class="left">SUPERSTITION</h3>

<p>The superstitious sporting editor of the paper condemned the "Horse
Fair" by Rosa Bonheur.</p>

<p>"Just look at those white horses!" he exclaimed disgustedly. "And not a
red-headed girl in sight."</p>

<h3 class="left">SUSPENSE</h3>

<p>The passionate lover wrote to his inamorata as follows:</p>

<p>"Adored of my soul:&mdash;If you love me, wear a red rose in your corsage
to-night at the opera. If my devotion to you is hopeless, wear a white
rose."</p>

<h3 class="left">SUSPICION</h3>

<p>The eminent politicians of opposing parties met on a train, and during
their chat discovered that they agreed concerning primaries.</p>

<p>"It is the first time," said one, "that we have ever agreed on a matter
of public policy."</p>

<p>"That is so," the other assented. "The fact leads me to suspect that I
am wrong, after all in this matter of the primaries."</p>

<h3 class="left">SYMPATHY</h3>

<p>A tramp devised a new scheme for working on the sympathy of the
housewife. After ringing the front door bell, he got on his knees, and
began nibbling at the grass of the lawn. Presently the woman opened the
door, and, in surprise at sight of him on all fours, asked what he was
doing there.</p>

<p>The tramp got to his feet shakily, and made an eloquent clutch at his
stomach as he explained:</p>

<p>"Dear madam, I am so hungry that like Nebuchadnezzar I just had to take
to eatin' grass."</p>

<p>"Well, well, now ain't that too bad!" the woman cried. "You go right
into the back yard&mdash;the grass there is longer."</p>

<h3 class="left">TACT</h3>

<p>The senator from Utah was able to disarm by flattery the resentment of a
woman at a reception in Washington, who upbraided him for that plurality
of wives so dear to Mormon precept and practice.</p>

<p>"Alas, madam," the senator declared with a touch of sadness in his
voice, "we are compelled in Utah to marry a number of wives."</p>

<p>His fair antagonist was frankly surprised.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she demanded.</p>

<p>The senator explained suavely:</p>

<p>"We have to seek there in several women the splendid qualities that here
are to be found in one."</p>

<h3 class="left">TALKING MACHINE</h3>

<p>Many a man who has suffered from tongue-lashings at home will be moved
to profound sympathy for the victim described as follows in a local news
item of a country paper:</p>

<p>"Alice Jardine, a married woman, was charged with unlawfully wounding
her husband, Charles Jardine, a laborer, by striking him with a pair of
tongues."</p>

<h3 class="left">TAR AND FEATHERS</h3>

<p>The victim of the Klu Klux Klan plucked some feathers from his neck with
one hand, while he picked gingerly at the tar on his legs with the
other.</p>

<p>"The excitement," he murmured, "rose to a terrible pitch, but it soon
came down."</p>

<h3 class="left">TASTE</h3>

<p>A noted humorist once spent a few weeks with a tribe of western Indians.
On his return, he was asked concerning his experiences. One question
was:</p>

<p>"Did you ever taste any dog-feast stew?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the melancholy reply. "I tasted it twice&mdash;once when it went
down, and once when it came up."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>It's all a matter of taste, as the old lady said when she kissed the

<p>The master of the house was hungry at breakfast, and swallowed a good
part of his bacon before he tasted it. Then he took time to protest
violently to his wife against the flavor of the food. The good lady
offered no apology, but rang for the servant. When the latter appeared,
the mistress asked a question that was little calculated to soothe her
husband.</p>

<p>"Maggie," she inquired serenely, "what did you do with the bacon we
poisoned for the rats?"</p>

<h3 class="left">TEARS</h3>

<p>The kind lady stopped to tell the sobbing little girl not to cry, and
she offered as a convincing argument:</p>

<p>"You know it makes little girls homely."</p>

<p>The child stared belligerently at the benevolent lady, and then
remarked:</p>

<p>"You must have cried an awful lot when you was young."</p>

<h3 class="left">TENDER MEMORIES</h3>

<p>"Please tell me, James," directed the young lady teacher, "where

<h3 class="left">TERMINOLOGY</h3>

<p>When the bishop was entertained at an English country house, the butler
coached carefully the new boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> who was to carry up the jug of hot water
for shaving in the morning.</p>

<p>"When you knock," the butler explained, "and he asks, 'Who's there?'
then you must say, 'It's the boy, my Lord.'"</p>

<p>The lad, in much nervous trepidation, duly carried up the hot water, but
in answer to the bishop's query as to who was at the door, he announced:</p>

<p>"It's the Lord, my boy!"</p>

<p>The butler overheard and was horrified. He hammered into the youth's
consciousness, the fact that a bishop must be addressed as my lord.
Finally, he was satisfied that the boy understood, and permitted him to
assist in serving the dinner that night. The youngster was sent to the
bishop to offer a plate of cheese. With shaking knees, he presented the
dish to the prelate, and faltered:</p>

<p>"My God, will you have some cheese?"</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The master of the house returned from business somewhat early. He did
not find his wife about, and so called downstairs to the cook:</p>

<p>"Bridget, do you know anything of my wife's whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"No, sor," Bridget answered, "Sure, I know nothin' but I'm thinkin',
sor, it's likely they're in the wash."</p>

<h3 class="left">TESTIMONY</h3>

<p>Paul Smith, the famous hotel-keeper in the Adirondacks, told of a law
suit that he had with a man named Jones in Malone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p><p>"It was this way: I sat in the courtroom before the case opened with my
witnesses around me. Then Jones bustled in. He stopped abruptly, and
looked my witnesses over carefully. Presently he turned to me.</p>

<p>"'Paul,' he asked, 'are those your witnesses?'</p>

<p>"'They are,' I replied.</p>

<p>"'Then you win,' he exclaimed. 'I've had them witnesses twice myself.'"</p>

<p>In one of the most desolate areas of Montana, a claim was taken by a man
from Iowa. The nearest neighbor, from twenty miles away, visited the
homesteader's shack, and introduced himself.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?" the visitor inquired presently, and when he
had been told:</p>

<p>"I can't understand why anybody should want to get out of that civilized
country to come and live in this lonesomeness."</p>

<p>"Fact was," the man from Iowa explained somberly, "I didn't exactly like
it down there any more. You see, it was this way. They got to telling
things about me. Why, they even said I was a liar and hoss thief, and no
better than I ought to be. And, by Jemima,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> I jest pulled out and went
right away from them scandalous folks."</p>

<p>"Well, I swan!" the visitor exclaimed indignantly. "You can bet I
wouldn't leave a place for any reason like that. I'd make them prove
what they said."</p>

<p>The homesteader sighed dismally as he answered:</p>

<p>"That's jest the trouble&mdash;they did prove it!"</p>

<h3 class="left">THREAT</h3>

<p>The mother, who was a believer in strict discipline, sternly addressed

the ogre approached forceps in hand:</p>

<p>A Scotchman was questioned by a friend:</p>

<p>The thrifty housewife regarded her dying husband with stern disapproval
as he moaned and tossed restlessly from side to side.</p>

<h3 class="left">TIME FLIES</h3>

<p>The ardent lover heard the clock strike the hours&mdash;first nine, then ten,
then eleven. At the sound of twelve strokes, he burst forth
passionately:</p>

<p>"How fleet are the hours in your presence, my beloved!"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly!" the girl chided. "That's pa setting the clock."</p>

<h3 class="left">TIT FOR TAT</h3>

<p>The prize bull-dog attacked a farmer, who defended himself with a
pitchfork, and in doing so killed the dog. The owner was greatly
distressed, and reproached the farmer.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you use the other end of the fork," he demanded, "and just
beat him off, without killing him?"</p>

<p>"I would have," the farmer answered, "if he had come at me with the
other end."</p>

<h3 class="left">TOBACCO</h3>

<p>The native pointed with pride to two doddering ancients hobbling
painfully down the village street, and informed the stranger:</p>

<p>"Them fellers is the Dusenbury twins&mdash;ninety-eight year old!" The
visitor was duly impressed, and asked to what the pair of venerable
citizens attributed their long life.</p>

<p>"It's kind o' which and t' other," the native confessed. "Obadiah

<h3 class="left">TOILETTE DETAILS</h3>

<p>The little girl who had observed certain details in the toilette
preparations of her elders, was observed by her mother at work over her
most elaborate doll in a somewhat strange manner.</p>

<p>"Whatever are you trying to do with your doll, Mary?" the mother asked.</p>

<p>"I'm just going to put her to bed, mummy," the child replied seriously.
"I've taken off her hair, but I can't get her teeth out."</p>

<h3 class="left">TONGUE</h3>

<p>An old lady in the London parish of the famous Doctor Gill made a
nuisance of herself by constant interference in the affairs of others.
As a gossip she was notorious. It appeared to her that the neckbands
worn by the Doctor were longer than was fitting. She therefore took
occasion to visit the clergyman, and harangued him at length on the
sinfulness of pride. Then she exhibited a pair of scissors, and
suggested that she should cut down the offending neckbands to a size
fitting her ideas of propriety. The Doctor listened patiently to her
exhortation, and at the end offered her the neckbands on which to work
her will. She triumphantly trimmed them to her taste, and returned the
shorn remnants to the minister.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p><p>"And now," said the Doctor, "you must do me a good turn also."</p>

<p>"That I will, Doctor," the woman declared heartily. "What can it be?"</p>

<p>"Well," the clergyman explained, "you have something about you which is
a deal too long and which causes me and many others such trouble, that I
should like to see it shorter."</p>

<p>"Indeed, dear Doctor, I shall not hesitate to gratify you. What is it?
See, here are the scissors! Use them as you please."</p>

<p>"Come, then," said the Doctor, "good sister, put out your tongue."</p>

<h3 class="left">TREACHERY</h3>

<p>The Italian workman in the West was warned to look out for rattlesnakes.
He was assured, however, that a snake would never strike until after
sounding the rattles. One day, while seated on a log, eating his lunch,
the Italian saw a rattlesnake coiled ready to strike. He lifted his legs
carefully, with the intention of darting away on the other side of the
log the moment the rattles should sound their warning. But just as his
feet cleared the top of the log, the snake struck out and its fangs were
buried in the wood only the fraction of an inch below the Italian's
trousers. The frightened man fled madly, but he took breath to shriek
over his shoulder:</p>

<p>"Son of a gun! Why you no ringa da bell?"</p>

<h3 class="left">TREASURE TROVE</h3>

<p>An old negro, who had almost attained the century mark, nearly blind,
almost completely disabled, without friends, relations, or money, felt
himself about to die, and stealthily made his way into a farmer's barn,
where he burrowed into the haymow. But the farmer had observed the man's
entrance, and after getting his shotgun, he hurried to the barn.</p>

<p>"I got you!" he cried savagely. "Dog gone you! I got you!"</p>

<p>The moribund derelict thrust his black face from the mow, and showed his
toothless gums in a grin, as he answered:</p>

<p>"An' a great git you got!"</p>

<h3 class="left">TRIAL</h3>

<p>The colored man was before the court, accused of horse-stealing. The

<p>When the domestic event was due, the prospective father, being ordered
out of the house, celebrated the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> occasion with many friends in a number
of saloons. He celebrated so well that the clock was striking three in
the morning when he entered the house. A nurse hurried to him, and undid
some wrappings that revealed three tiny faces. The father stared
reproachfully at the clock in the hall, and then, again regarding his
group of children, spoke earnestly:</p>

<p>"Oi'm not superstitious, but Oi thank hivin Oi didn't come home at

<h3 class="left">TRUTH-TELLERS</h3>

<p>The little girl evidently appreciated the fact that all men and women

<p><i>Mother:</i> "It is very naughty to tell untruths, Kitty. Those who do so,
never go to heaven."</p>

<p><i>Kitty:</i> "Don't you ever tell an untruth, Mummy?"</p>

Washington?"</p>

<h3 class="left">TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR</h3>

<p>The woman lecturing on dress reform was greatly shocked when she read
the report as published in the local paper. The writer had been innocent
enough, for his concluding sentence was:</p>

<p>"The lady lecturer on dress wore nothing that was remarkable."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p><p>But the merry compositor inserted a period, which was left undisturbed
by the proofreader, so that the published statement ran:</p>

<p>"The lady lecturer on dress wore nothing. That was remarkable."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The poet, in a fine frenzy, dashed off a line that was really superb:</p>

<p>"See the pale martyr in his sheet of fire."</p>

<p>The devilish compositor so tangled the words that, when the poem was
published, this line read:</p>

<p>"See the pale martyr with his shirt on fire."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The critic, in his review of the burlesque, wrote:</p>

<p>"The ladies of Prince Charming's household troops filled their parts to
perfection."</p>

<p>The compositor, in his haste, read an <i>n</i> for the <i>r</i> in the word
<i>parts</i>, and the sentence, thus changed, radically in its significance,
duly appeared in the morning paper.</p>

<h3 class="left">VALUES</h3>

<p>An American girl who married a Bavarian baron enjoyed playing Lady
Bountiful among the tenants on her husband's estate. On the death of the
wife of one of the cottagers, she called to condole with the bereaved
widower. She uttered her formal expressions of sympathy with him in his
grief over the loss of his wife, and she was then much disconcerted by
his terse optimistic comment:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p><p>"But it's a good thing, your ladyship, that it wasn't the cow."</p>

<h3 class="left">VANITY</h3>

<p>The fair penitent explained to the confessor how greatly she was grieved
by an accusing conscience. She bewailed the fact that she was sadly
given over to personal vanity. She added that on this very morning she
had gazed into her mirror and had yielded to the temptation of thinking
herself beautiful.</p>

<p>"Is that all, my daughter?" the priest demanded.</p>

<p>"Then, my daughter," the confessor bade her, "go in peace, for to be
mistaken is not to sin."</p>

<h3 class="left">VICTORY</h3>

<p>That celebrated statue, the Winged Victory, has suffered during the

When the Irish tourist was confronted by this battered figure in the

victory, he surveyed the marble form with keen interest.</p>

<p>"Victory, is ut?" he said, "Thin, begorra, Oi'd loike to see the other

<h3 class="left">WAR</h3>

<p>A report has come from Mexico concerning the doings of three
revolutionary soldiers who visited a ranch, which was the property of an
American spinster and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> her two nieces. The girls are pretty and
charming, but the aunt is somewhat elderly and much faded, though
evidently of a dauntless spirit. The three soldiers looked over the
property and the three women, and then declared that they were tired of
fighting, and had decided to marry the women and make their home on the
ranch.</p>

<p>The two girls were greatly distressed and terrified, but even in their
misery they were unselfish.</p>

<p>"We are but two helpless women," they said in effect, "and if we must,
we bow to our cruel fate. But please&mdash;oh, please&mdash;spare our dear auntie.
Do not marry her."</p>

<p>At this point, their old-maid relation spoke up for herself:</p>

<p>"For various reasons," explained the father. "Now, there was Germany and
Russia. They went to war because the Russians mobilized."</p>

<p>"Not at all, my dear," the wife interrupted. "It was because the
Austrians&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, my love!" the husband remonstrated. "Don't you suppose I

<p>At our entry into the World War, a popular young man enlisted and before
setting forth for camp in his uniform made a round of farewell calls.
The girl who first received him made an insistent demand:</p>

<p>"You'll think of me every single minute when you're in those stupid old
trenches!"</p>

<p>"Every minute," he agreed solemnly.</p>

<p>"And you'll kiss my picture every night."</p>

<p>"Twice a night," he vowed, with the girl's pretty head on the shoulder
of the new uniform coat.</p>

<p>"And you'll write me long, long letters?" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"I'll write every spare minute," he assured her, "and if I haven't any
spare minutes, I'll take 'em anyhow."</p>

<p>After a tender interval punctuated with similar ardent promises, he went
away from there, and called on another girl. In fact, he called on ten
separate and distinct pretty girls, and each of them was tender and
sought his promises, which he gave freely and ardently and when it was
all done with, he communed with himself somewhat sadly.</p>

<p>"I do hope," he said wearily, "there won't be much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> fighting to do over
there&mdash;for I'm going to be awfully busy."</p>

<p>The old colored attendant at the court house had a formula for
addressing the judge:</p>

<p>And the judge's habitual reply was to the effect that there was no news
in particular.</p>

<p>But one morning, in answer to the usual query, there came a variation:</p>

<p>"Our country has declared war against Spain." The darky scratched his
head thoughtfully, then rolled his eyes to squint at the cloudless blue
of the sky, and finally remarked in a pleased tone:</p>

<p>An elderly man was on his way home by train from a session of three days
at a convention of his political<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> party. (This was antedating the era of
prohibition.) The man's personal preferences had been gratified in the
nominations at the convention, and he had celebrated in a way only too
common in the bibulous period of our history. His absorption in other
things and of other things had led him to neglect shaving throughout the
three days. Now, as he chanced to move his hand over his chin, it
encountered the long growth of white bristles, and he was aroused to a
realization of his neglect. To determine just how badly he needed a
shave, the elderly gentleman opened his handbag, and fumbled in it for a
mirror. In his confused condition, he seized on a silver-backed
hair-brush of the same set, pulled it forth, and held it up to his face
with the bristles toward him. He studied these with great care, groaned
and muttered:</p>

<p>"I look worse than I thought for. Whatever will Sarah Ann say!"</p>

<p>"Dear John," the widow questioned eagerly, "are you happy now?"</p>

<h3 class="left">WIDOWHOOD</h3>

<p>During the parade at the last encampment of the G.A.R., a woman in the
crowd of spectators made herself not only conspicuous, but rather a
nuisance by the way she carried on. She waved a flag with such vigor as
to endanger the bystanders and yelled to deafen them. An annoyed man in
the crowd after politely requesting her to moderate her enthusiasm,
quite without effect, bluntly told her to shut up.</p>

<p>"Shut up yourself!" she retorted in high indignation. "If you had buried
two husbands who had served in the war, you would be hurrahing, too."</p>

<h3 class="left">WIFE</h3>

<p>A young skeptic in the congregation once interrupted Billy Sunday with
the question:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p><p>"Who was Cain's wife?"</p>

<p>The Evangelist answered in all seriousness:</p>

<p>"I honor every seeker after knowledge of the truth. But I have a word of
warning for this questioner. Don't risk losing salvation by too much
inquiring after other men's wives."</p>

<h3 class="left">WILD WOMEN</h3>

<p>The old sea captain was surrounded at the tea party, to which his wife
had dragged him, much against his will, by a group of women pestering
him for a story from his adventures. Finally, at the end of his
patience, he began.</p>

<p>"Once, I was shipwrecked on the coast of South America, and there I came
across a tribe of wild women, who had no tongues."</p>

<p>"Mercy!" exclaimed all the fair listeners with one voice. "But they
couldn't talk."</p>

<p>"That," snapped the old sea captain, "was what made them wild."</p>

<h3 class="left">WISDOM</h3>

<p>It's a wise child that goes out of the room to laugh when the old man
mashes his thumb.</p>

<h3 class="left">WOMAN</h3>

<p>A cynic, considering the fact that women was the last thing made by God,
asserts that the product shows both His experience and His fatigue.</p>

<p>The following extract is from the diary of a New England woman who lived
in the eighteenth century:</p>

<p>"We had roast pork for dinner and the Doctor, who carved, held up a rib
on his fork, and said: 'Here, ladies, is what Mother Eve was made of.'"</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said sister Patty, 'and it is from very much the same kind of
critter'."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>

<p>The little girl reported at home what she had learned at Sunday School
concerning the creation of Adam and Eve:</p>

<p>"The teacher told us how God made the first man and the first woman. He
made the man first. But the man was very lonely with nobody to talk to
him. So God put the man to sleep. And while the man was asleep, God took
out his brains, and made a woman of them."</p>

<h3 class="left">WOMAN SUFFRAGE</h3>

<p>During the agitation in behalf of woman's suffrage, an ardent advocate
pleaded with a tired-looking married woman, and said:</p>

<p>"Just think! Wouldn't you love to go with your husband to the voting
place, and there cast your vote along with his?"</p>

<p>The woman shook her head decisively and she answered:</p>

<p>"For goodness sake! If there's one single thing that a man's able to do
by himself, let him do it."</p>

first time of his life, his amazement was great.</p>

<p>The vastness of his surroundings completely dazzled him, but when the
3.30 express dashed through the station, that did it. He kept his eyes
glued on the tunnel through which it had disappeared, staring after it
as though some kind of miracle had happened. He remained like this for
several minutes, much to the amusement of the onlookers, until at length
an inquisitive porter asked him what he was staring at.</p>

<p>They were talking over the days that will never return, so they
asserted; the days when there was no thirst in the land. But they had
particular reference to the old state militia camp of long ago. For be
it known, there was much taken to camp in those days that had little to
do with military training, and it was carried in capacious jugs and big
bottles. Everybody expected his city friends to run down to the camp,
and be called upon to act as an assuager of thirst. "The year I have
reference to," said one of the old-timers, "was a notably wet one. The
first night in camp everybody seemed to be bent on sampling what
everybody else had brought down from the city. The result was that when
the company of which I was a member was ordered to fall in the next
morning to answer the roll-call there was a pretty wobbly line-up. We
had a new sergeant&mdash;new to the routine of a camp, and after he had
checked up he should have reported, 'Sir, the company is present and
accounted for.' Instead he got rattled and said, 'Sir, the company is
full.' Our captain, looking us over, sarcastically remarked, 'I should
say as much, full as a tick.'"</p>

his last trip came was absolutely fed up by being asked silly questions.
He told his passengers, two ladies, that on no account were they to
speak to him; that he could not talk and give his attention to his
machine, and that they must keep silent. Up they went, and the airman
quite enjoyed himself. He looped the loop and practiced all sorts of

until he felt a touch on his arm. "What is it?" he said impatiently.

titles of pictures in general, and the tiny blonde expressed regret that

'Passion,' think what a hit it would have made!"</p>

vivacious son and heir had found the memorandum in his study on the

celebrating the increased severity of dry law enforcement, had
diabolically changed the chapter and verse numerals to indicate a very

<p>Wishing to give his Scotch steward a treat a man invited him to London,
and on the night after his arrival took him to a hotel to dine. During
the early part of the dinner the steward was noticed to help himself
very liberally to the champagne, glass after glass of the wine
disappearing. Still he seemed very downhearted and morose. Presently he
was heard to remark, "Well, I hope they'll not be very long wi' the
whisky, as I dinna get on verra weel wi' these mineral waters."</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
