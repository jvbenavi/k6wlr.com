<div style="background: #EEEEEE; padding: 2em; border: dashed 1px;"><p>Transcribers note: Many of the puzzles in this book assume a
familiarity with the currency of Great Britain in the early 1900s. As
this is likely not common knowledge for those outside Britain (and possibly
many within,) I am including a chart of relative values.</p>

<p>The most common units used were:</p>

<tr><td align='left'>the Pound,</td><td align='left'>abbreviated: £</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>There was 12 Pennies to a Shilling and 20 Shillings to a Pound, so there
was 240 Pennies in a Pound.</p>

<p>To further complicate things, there were many coins which were various
fractional values of Pennies, Shillings or Pounds.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>In issuing this volume of my Mathematical Puzzles, of which some have
appeared in periodicals and others are given here for the first time,
I must acknowledge the encouragement that I have received from many
unknown correspondents, at home and abroad, who have expressed a
desire to have the problems in a collected form, with some of the
solutions given at greater length than is possible in magazines and
newspapers. Though I have included a few old puzzles that have
interested the world for generations, where I felt that there was
something new to be said about them, the problems are in the main
original. It is true that some of these have become widely known
through the press, and it is possible that the reader may be glad to
know their source.</p>

<p>On the question of Mathematical Puzzles in general there is, perhaps,
little more to be said than I have written elsewhere. The history of
the subject entails nothing short of the actual story of the
beginnings and development of exact thinking in man. The historian
must start from the time when man first succeeded in counting his ten
fingers and in dividing an apple into two approximately equal parts.
Every puzzle that is worthy of consideration can be referred to
mathematics and logic. Every man, woman, and child who tries to
"reason out" the answer to the simplest puzzle is working, though not
of necessity consciously, on mathematical lines. Even those puzzles
that we have no way of attacking except by haphazard attempts can be
brought under a method of what has been called "glorified trial"&mdash;a
system of shortening our labours by avoiding or eliminating what our
reason tells us is useless. It is, in fact, not easy to say sometimes
where the "empirical" begins and where it ends.</p>

<p>When a man says, "I have never solved a puzzle in my life," it is
difficult to know exactly what he means, for every intelligent
individual is doing it every day. The unfortunate inmates of our
lunatic asylums are sent there expressly because they cannot solve
puzzles&mdash;because they have lost their powers of reason. If there were
no puzzles to solve, there would be no questions to ask; and if there
were no questions to be asked, what a world it would be! We should all
be equally omniscient, and conversation would be useless and idle.</p>

<p>It is possible that some few exceedingly sober-minded mathematicians,
who are impatient of any terminology in their favourite science but
the academic, and who object to the elusive <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> appearing
under any other names, will have wished that various problems had
been presented in a less popular dress and introduced with a less
flippant phraseology. I can only refer them to the first word of my
title and remind them that we are primarily out to be amused&mdash;not, it
is true, without some hope of picking up morsels of knowledge by the
way. If the manner is light, I can only say, in the words of
Touchstone, that it is "an ill-favoured thing, sir, but my own; a poor
humour of mine, sir."</p>

<p>As for the question of difficulty, some of the puzzles, especially in
the Arithmetical and Algebraical category, are quite easy. Yet some of
those examples that look the simplest should not be passed over
without a little consideration, for now and again it will be found
that there is some more or less subtle pitfall or trap into which the
reader may be apt to fall. It is good exercise to cultivate the habit
of being very wary over the exact wording of a puzzle. It teaches
exactitude and caution. But some of the problems are very hard nuts
indeed, and not unworthy of the attention of the advanced
mathematician. Readers will doubtless select according to their
individual tastes.</p>

<p>In many cases only the mere answers are given. This leaves the
beginner something to do on his own behalf in working out the method
of solution, and saves space that would be wasted from the point of
view of the advanced student. On the other hand, in particular cases
where it seemed likely to interest, I have given rather extensive
solutions and treated problems in a general manner. It will often be
found that the notes on one problem will serve to elucidate a good
many others in the book; so that the reader's difficulties will
sometimes be found cleared up as he advances. Where it is possible to
say a thing in a manner that may be "understanded of the people"
generally, I prefer to use this simple phraseology, and so engage the
attention and interest of a larger public. The mathematician will in
such cases have no difficulty in expressing the matter under
consideration in terms of his familiar symbols.</p>

<p>I have taken the greatest care in reading the proofs, and trust that
any errors that may have crept in are very few. If any such should
occur, I can only plead, in the words of Horace, that "good Homer
sometimes nods," or, as the bishop put it, "Not even the youngest
curate in my diocese is infallible."</p>

<p>I have to express my thanks in particular to the proprietors of <i>The
Strand Magazine</i>, <i>Cassell's Magazine</i>, <i>The Queen</i>, <i>Tit-Bits</i>, and
<i>The Weekly Dispatch</i> for their courtesy in allowing me to reprint
some of the puzzles that have appeared in their pages.</p>

<p>The puzzles in this department are roughly thrown together in classes
for the convenience of the reader. Some are very easy, others quite
difficult. But they are not arranged in any order of difficulty&mdash;and
this is intentional, for it is well that the solver should not be
warned that a puzzle is just what it seems to be. It may, therefore,
prove to be quite as simple as it looks, or it may contain some
pitfall into which, through want of care or over-confidence, we may
stumble.</p>

<p>Also, the arithmetical and algebraical puzzles are not separated in
the manner adopted by some authors, who arbitrarily require certain
problems to be solved by one method or the other. The reader is left
to make his own choice and determine which puzzles are capable of
being solved by him on purely arithmetical lines.</p>

<p>In every business of life we are occasionally perplexed by some chance
question that for the moment staggers us. I quite pitied a young lady
in a branch post-office when a gentleman entered and deposited a crown
on the counter with this request: "Please give me some twopenny
stamps, six times as many penny stamps, and make up the rest of the
money in twopence-halfpenny stamps." For a moment she seemed
bewildered, then her brain cleared, and with a smile she handed over
stamps in exact fulfilment of the order. How long would it have taken
you to think it out?</p>

<p>The precocity of some youths is surprising. One is disposed to say on
occasion, "That boy of yours is a genius, and he is certain to do
great things when he grows up;" but past experience has taught us that
he invariably becomes quite an ordinary citizen. It is so often the
case, on the contrary, that the dull boy becomes a great man. You
never can tell. Nature loves to present to us these queer paradoxes.
It is well known that those wonderful "lightning calculators," who now
and again surprise the world by their feats, lose all their mysterious
powers directly they are taught the elementary rules of arithmetic.</p>

<p>A boy who was demolishing a choice banana was approached by a young
friend, who, regarding him with envious eyes, asked, "How much did you
pay for that banana, Fred?" The prompt answer was quite remarkable in
its way: "The man what I bought it of receives just half as many
sixpences for sixteen dozen dozen bananas as he gives bananas for a
fiver."</p>

<p>Now, how long will it take the reader to say correctly just how much
Fred paid for his rare and refreshing fruit?</p>

<p>Three countrymen met at a cattle market. "Look here," said Hodge to
Jakes, "I'll give you six of my pigs for one of your horses, and then
you'll have twice as many animals here as I've got." "If that's your
way of doing business," said Durrant to Hodge, "I'll give you fourteen
of my sheep for a horse, and then you'll have three times as many
animals as I." "Well, I'll go better than that," said Jakes to
Durrant; "I'll give you four cows for a horse, <span class='pagenum'>Pg 2<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>and then you'll have
six times as many animals as I've got here."</p>

<p>No doubt this was a very primitive way of bartering animals, but it is
an interesting little puzzle to discover just how many animals Jakes,
Hodge, and Durrant must have taken to the cattle market.</p>

<p>A number of men went out together on a bean-feast. There were four
parties invited&mdash;namely, 25 cobblers, 20 tailors, 18 hatters, and 12
glovers. They spent altogether &pound;6, 13<i>s</i>. It was found that five
cobblers spent as much as four tailors; that twelve tailors spent as
much as nine hatters; and that six hatters spent as much as eight
glovers. The puzzle is to find out how much each of the four parties

<p>Seven men, whose names were Adams, Baker, Carter, Dobson, Edwards,
Francis, and Gudgeon, were recently engaged in play. The name of the
particular game is of no consequence. They had agreed that whenever a
player won a game he should double the money of each of the other
players&mdash;that is, he was to give the players just as much money as
they had already in their pockets. They played seven games, and,
strange to say, each won a game in turn, in the order in which their
names are given. But a more curious coincidence is this&mdash;that when
they had finished play each of the seven men had exactly the same
amount&mdash;two shillings and eightpence&mdash;in his pocket. The puzzle is to
find out how much money each man had with him before he sat down to
play.</p>

<p>"This is queer," said McCrank to his friend. "Twopence added to
twopence is fourpence, and twopence multiplied by twopence is also
fourpence." Of course, he was wrong in thinking you can multiply money
by money. The multiplier must be regarded as an abstract number. It is
true that two feet multiplied by two feet will make four square feet.
Similarly, two pence multiplied by two pence will produce four square
pence! And it will perplex the reader to say what a "square penny" is.
But we will assume for the purposes of our puzzle that twopence
multiplied by twopence is fourpence. Now, what two amounts of money

It bored him. So he determined to persecute some of his poor but happy
friends with it. They had never done him any harm, but he resolved to
inoculate them with the "source of all evil." He therefore proposed to
distribute a million dollars among them and watch them go rapidly to
the bad. But he was a man of strange fancies and superstitions, and it
was an inviolable rule with him never to make a gift that was not
either one dollar or some power of seven&mdash;such as 7, 49, 343, 2,401,
which numbers of dollars are produced by simply multiplying sevens
together. Another rule of his was that he would never give more than
six persons exactly the same sum. Now, how was he to distribute the

<p>The Chinese are a curious people, and have strange inverted ways of

instead of a downward one, that they plane a deal board by pulling the
tool toward them instead of pushing it, and that in building a house
they first construct the roof and, having raised that into position,
proceed to work downwards. In money the currency of the country
consists of taels of fluctuating value. The tael became thinner and
thinner until 2,000 of them piled together made less than three inches
in height. The common cash consists of brass coins of varying
thicknesses, with a round, square, or triangular hole in the centre,

<p>Every one is familiar with the difficulties that frequently arise over
the giving of change, and how the assistance of a third person with a
few coins in his pocket will sometimes help us to set the matter
right. Here is an example. An Englishman went into a shop in New York
and bought goods at a cost of thirty-four cents. The only money he had

had only a half-dollar and a quarter-dollar. But another customer
happened to be present, and when asked to help produced two dimes, a
five-cent piece, a two-cent piece, and a one-cent piece. How did the
tradesman manage to give change? For the benefit of those readers who
are not familiar with the American coinage, it is only necessary to
say that a dollar is a hundred cents and a dime ten cents. A puzzle of

Some people are so unobservant that, although they are handling the

the fact that these rustics paid their fares in such a lot of small

the congregations of three parish churches. "That excursion fare,"
said he, "is nineteen shillings and ninepence, and I should like to

<p>Most people know that if you take any sum of money in pounds,
shillings, and pence, in which the number of pounds (less than &pound;12)
exceeds that of the pence, reverse it (calling the pounds pence and
the pence pounds), find the difference, then reverse and add this
difference, the result is always &pound;12, 18<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>. But if we omit the
condition, "less than &pound;12," and allow nought to represent shillings or
pence&mdash;(1) What is the lowest amount to which the rule will not apply?
(2) What is the highest amount to which it will apply? Of course, when
reversing such a sum as &pound;14, 15<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. it may be written &pound;3, 16<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>.,
which is the same as &pound;3, 15<i>s</i>. 14<i>d</i>.</p>

<p>A country "grocer and draper" had two rival assistants, who prided
themselves on their rapidity in serving customers. The young man on
the grocery side could weigh up two one-pound parcels of sugar per
minute, while the drapery assistant could cut three one-yard lengths
of cloth in the same time. Their employer, one slack day, set them a
race, giving <span class='pagenum'>Pg 6<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>the grocer a barrel of sugar and telling him to weigh up
forty-eight one-pound parcels of sugar While the draper divided a roll
of forty-eight yards of cloth into yard pieces. The two men were
interrupted together by customers for nine minutes, but the draper was
disturbed seventeen times as long as the grocer. What was the result

<p>As the purchase of apples in small quantities has always presented
considerable difficulties, I think it well to offer a few remarks on
this subject. We all know the story of the smart boy who, on being
told by the old woman that she was selling her apples at four for
threepence, said: "Let me see! Four for threepence; that's three for
twopence, two for a penny, one for nothing&mdash;I'll take <i>one</i>!"</p>

<p>There are similar cases of perplexity. For example, a boy once picked
up a penny apple from a stall, but when he learnt that the woman's
pears were the same price he exchanged it, and was about to walk off.
"Stop!" said the woman. "You haven't paid me for the pear!" "No," said
the boy, "of course not. I gave you the apple for it." "But you didn't
pay for the apple!" "Bless the woman! You don't expect me to pay for
the apple and the pear too!" And before the poor creature could get
out of the tangle the boy had disappeared.</p>

<p>Then, again, we have the case of the man who gave a boy sixpence and
promised to repeat the gift as soon as the youngster had made it into
ninepence. Five minutes later the boy returned. "I have made it into
ninepence," he said, at the same time handing his benefactor
threepence. "How do you make that out?" he was asked. "I bought
threepennyworth of apples." "But that does not make it into
ninepence!" "I should rather think it did," was the boy's reply. "The
apple woman has threepence, hasn't she? Very well, I have
threepennyworth of apples, and I have just given you the other
threepence. What's that but ninepence?"</p>

<p>I cite these cases just to show that the small boy really stands in
need of a little instruction in the art of buying apples. So I will
give a simple poser dealing with this branch of commerce.</p>

<p>An old woman had apples of three sizes for sale&mdash;one a penny, two a
penny, and three a penny. Of course two of the second size and three
of the third size were respectively equal to one apple of the largest
size. Now, a gentleman who had an equal number of boys and girls gave
his children sevenpence to be spent amongst them all on these apples.
The puzzle is to give each child an equal distribution of apples. How
was the sevenpence spent, and how many children were there?</p>

<p>Though the following little puzzle deals with the purchase of
chestnuts, it is not itself of the "chestnut" type. It is quite new.
At first sight it has certainly the appearance of being of the
"nonsense puzzle" character, but it is all right when properly
considered.</p>

<p>A man went to a shop to buy chestnuts. He said he wanted a pennyworth,
and was given five chestnuts. "It is not enough; I ought to have a
sixth," he remarked! "But if I give you one chestnut more." the
shopman replied, "you will have five too many." Now, strange to say,
they were both right. How many chestnuts should the buyer receive for
half a crown?</p>

him to change the cheque for him, and the cyclist, having received his
&pound;10 change, mounted the machine and disappeared. The cheque proved to
be valueless, and the salesman was requested by his neighbour to
refund the amount he had received. To do this, he was compelled to
borrow the &pound;25 from a friend, as the cyclist forgot to leave his
address, and could not be found. Now, as the bicycle cost the salesman

<p>For centuries it has been a favourite method of propounding
arithmetical puzzles to pose them in the form of questions as to the
age of an individual. They generally lend themselves to very easy
solution by the use of algebra, though often the difficulty lies in
stating them <span class='pagenum'>Pg 7<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>correctly. They may be made very complex and may demand
considerable ingenuity, but no general laws can well be laid down for
their solution. The solver must use his own sagacity. As for puzzles
in relationship or kinship, it is quite curious how bewildering many
people find these things. Even in ordinary conversation, some
statement as to relationship, which is quite clear in the mind of the
speaker, will immediately tie the brains of other people into knots.
Such expressions as "He is my uncle's son-in-law's sister" convey
absolutely nothing to some people without a detailed and laboured
explanation. In such cases the best course is to sketch a brief
genealogical table, when the eye comes immediately to the assistance
of the brain. In these days, when we have a growing lack of respect
for pedigrees, most people have got out of the habit of rapidly
drawing such tables, which is to be regretted, as they would save a
lot of time and brain racking on occasions.</p>

<p>"Speaking of relationships," said the Parson at a certain
dinner-party, "our legislators are getting the marriage law into a
frightful tangle, Here, for example, is a puzzling case that has come
under my notice. Two brothers married two sisters. One man died and
the other man's wife also died. Then the survivors married."</p>

<p>"The man married his deceased wife's sister under the recent Act?" put
in the Lawyer.</p>

<p>"Exactly. And therefore, under the civil law, he is legally married
and his child is legitimate. But, you see, the man is the woman's
deceased husband's brother, and therefore, also under the civil law,
she is not married to him and her child is illegitimate."</p>

<p>"He is married to her and she is not married to him!" said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Quite so. And the child is the legitimate son of his father, but the
illegitimate son of his mother."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly 'the law is a hass,'" the Artist exclaimed, "if I may be

beast to the service of man. Our legislators are responsible for the
breed."</p>

widow? Do you marry dead men in your parish?"</p>

<p>"No; but I will explain that later. Well, this man has a sister of his
own. Their names are Stephen Brown and Jane Brown. Last week a young
fellow turned up whom Stephen introduced to me as his nephew.
Naturally, I spoke of Jane as his aunt, but, to my astonishment, the
youth corrected me, assuring me that, though he was the nephew of
Stephen, he was not the nephew of Jane, the sister of Stephen. This

had no homes, and perhaps each was conscious of the fact that he was
in that predicament himself. In any case they seemed to be perfectly

in making an ascent with him. However, an uncle of mine thought he

something or other, when my nephew&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

machine?"</p>

shouted back to Parker&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Phew! I'm sorry to interrupt you again, Wilson, but we can't get on
like this. Is it true that the machine would only carry two?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I said at the start that it only carried two."</p>

<p>"Wilson, I have known you for some time as a truthful man and a
temperate man," said Mr. Stubbs, solemnly. "But I am afraid since you
took up that new line of goods you have overworked yourself."</p>

<p>"Half a minute, Stubbs," interposed Mr. Waterson. "I see clearly where
we all slipped a cog. Of course, Wilson, you meant us to understand
that Parker is either your uncle or your nephew. Now we shall be all
right if you will just tell us whether Parker is your uncle or
nephew."</p>

<p>"He is no relation to me whatever."</p>

<p>The three men sighed and looked anxiously at one another. Mr. Stubbs
got up from his chair to reach the matches, Mr. Packhurst proceeded to
wind up his watch, and Mr. Waterson took up the poker to attend to the
fire. It was an awkward moment, for at the season of goodwill nobody
wished to tell Mr. Wilson exactly what was in his mind.</p>

<p>"It's curious," said Mr. Wilson, very deliberately, "and it's rather
sad, how thick-headed some people are. You don't seem to grip the
facts. It never seems to have occurred to either of you that my uncle
and my nephew are one and the same man."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed all three together.</p>

<p>"Yes; David George Linklater is my uncle, and he is also my nephew.
Consequently, I am both his uncle and nephew. Queer, isn't it? I'll
explain how it comes about."</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson put the case so very simply that the three men saw how it
might happen without any marriage within the prohibited degrees.
Perhaps the reader can work it out for himself.</p>

<p>In considering a few puzzles concerning clocks and watches, and the
times recorded by their hands under given conditions, it is well that
a particular convention should always be kept in mind. It is
frequently the case that a solution requires the assumption that the
hands can actually record a time involving a minute fraction of a
second. Such a time, of course, cannot be really indicated. Is the
puzzle, therefore, impossible of solution? The conclusion deduced from
a logical syllogism depends for its truth on the two premises assumed,
and it is the same in mathematics. Certain things are antecedently
assumed, and the answer depends entirely on the truth of those
assumptions.</p>

<p>"If two horses," says Lagrange, "can pull a load of a certain weight,
it is natural to suppose that four horses could pull a load of double
that weight, six horses a load of three times that weight. Yet,
strictly speaking, such is not the <span class='pagenum'>Pg 10<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>case. For the inference is based
on the assumption that the four horses pull alike in amount and
direction, which in practice can scarcely ever be the case. It so
happens that we are frequently led in our reckonings to results which
diverge widely from reality. But the fault is not the fault of
mathematics; for mathematics always gives back to us exactly what we
have put into it. The ratio was constant according to that
supposition. The result is founded upon that supposition. If the
supposition is false the result is necessarily false."</p>

<p>If one man can reap a field in six days, we say two men will reap it
in three days, and three men will do the work in two days. We here
assume, as in the case of Lagrange's horses, that all the men are
exactly equally capable of work. But we assume even more than this.
For when three men get together they may waste time in gossip or play;
or, on the other hand, a spirit of rivalry may spur them on to greater
diligence. We may assume any conditions we like in a problem, provided
they be clearly expressed and understood, and the answer will be in
accordance with those conditions.</p>

<p>There was a great commotion in Lower Thames Street on the morning of
January 12, 1887. When the early members of the staff arrived at
Wapshaw's Wharf they found that the safe had been broken open, a
considerable sum of money removed, and the offices left in great
disorder. The night watchman was nowhere to be found, but nobody who
had been acquainted with him for one moment suspected him to be guilty
of the robbery. In this belief the proprietors were confirmed when,
later in the day, they were informed that the poor fellow's body had
been picked up by the River Police. Certain marks of violence pointed
to the fact that he had been brutally attacked and thrown into the
river. A watch found in his pocket had stopped, as is invariably the
case in such circumstances, and this was a valuable clue to the time
of the outrage. But a very stupid officer (and we invariably find one
or two stupid individuals in the most intelligent bodies of men) had
actually amused himself by turning the hands round and round, trying
to set the watch going again. After he had been severely reprimanded
for this serious indiscretion, he was asked whether he could remember
the time that was indicated by the watch when found. He replied that
he could not, but he recollected that the hour hand and minute hand
were exactly together, one above the other, and the second hand had
just passed the forty-ninth second. More than this he could not
remember.</p>

<p>What was the exact time at which the watchman's watch stopped? The
watch is, of course, assumed to have been an accurate one.</p>

there are lightermen." Unfortunately it had to be explained to Mrs.

was from Slocomb to the neighbouring watering-place Poodleville&mdash;five

<p>I give these puzzles, dealing with the nine digits, a class to
themselves, because I have always thought that they deserve more
consideration than they usually receive. Beyond the mere trick of
"casting out nines," very little seems to be generally known of the
laws involved in these problems, and yet an acquaintance with the
properties of the digits often supplies, among other uses, a certain
number of arithmetical checks that are of real value in the saving of
labour. Let me give just one example&mdash;the first that occurs to me.</p>

<p>If the reader were required to determine whether or not
15,763,530,163,289 is a square number, how would he proceed? If the
number had ended with a 2, 3, 7, or 8 in the digits place, of course
he would know that it could not be a square, but there is nothing in
its apparent form to prevent its being one. I suspect that in such a
case he would set to work, with a sigh or a groan, at the laborious
task of extracting the square root. Yet if he had given a little
attention to the study of the digital properties of numbers, he would
settle the question in this simple way. The sum of the digits is 59,
the sum of which is 14, the sum of which is 5 (which I call the
"digital root"), and therefore I know that the number cannot be a
square, and for this reason. The digital root of successive square
numbers from 1 upwards is always 1, 4, 7, or 9, and can never be
anything else. In fact, the series, 1, 4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1, 9, is
repeated into infinity. The analogous series for triangular numbers is
1, 3, 6, 1, 6, 3, 1, 9, 9. So here we have a similar negative check,
for a number cannot be triangular (that is, (n&sup2;+n)/2) if its digital
root be 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8.</p>

as shown in the diagram. He told his clerk to place a different
one-figure number on each locker of cupboard A, and to do the same in
the case of B, and of C. As we are here allowed to call nought a

clearly had the option of omitting any one of ten digits from each

that the figures had apparently been mixed up indiscriminately.
Calling upon his clerk for an explanation, the eccentric lad stated
that the notion had occurred to him so to arrange the figures that in
each case they formed a simple addition sum, the two upper rows of
figures producing the sum in the lowest row. But the most surprising
point was this: that he had so arranged them that the addition in A
gave the smallest possible sum, that the addition in C gave the
largest possible sum, and that all the nine digits in the three totals
were different. The puzzle is to show how this could be done. No
decimals are allowed and the nought may not appear in the hundreds

<p>There appeared in "Nouvelles Annales de Math&eacute;matiques" the following
puzzle as a modification of one of my "Canterbury Puzzles." Arrange
the nine digits in three groups of two, three, and four digits, so
that the first two numbers when multiplied together make the third.
Thus, 12&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;483&nbsp;=&nbsp;5,796. I now also propose to include the cases where
there are one, four, and four digits, such as 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1,738&nbsp;=&nbsp;6,952. Can
you find all the possible solutions in both cases?</p>

<p>I have nine counters, each bearing one of the nine digits, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. I arranged them on the table in two groups, as shown
in the illustration, so as to form two multiplication sums, and found
that both sums gave the same product. You will find that 158
multiplied by 23 is 3,634, and that 79 multiplied by 46 is also 3,634.
Now, the puzzle I propose is to rearrange the counters so as to get as
large a product as possible. What is the best way of placing them?
Remember both groups must multiply to the same amount, and there must
be three counters multiplied by two in one case, and two multiplied by
two counters in the other, just as at present.</p>

<p>In this case we use the nought in addition to the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9. The puzzle is, as in the last case, so to arrange the ten
counters that the products of the two multiplications shall be the
same, and you may here have one or more figures in the multiplier, as
you choose. The above is a very easy feat; but it is also required to
find the two arrangements giving pairs of the highest and lowest
products possible. Of course every counter must be used, and the
cipher may not be placed to the left of a row of figures where it
would have no effect. Vulgar fractions or decimals are not allowed.</p>

<p>Here is another entertaining problem with the nine digits, the nought
being excluded. Using each figure once, and only once, we can form two
multiplication sums that have the same product, and this may be done
in many ways. For example, 7x658 and 14x329 contain all the digits
once, and the product in each case is the same&mdash;4,606. Now, it will be
seen that the sum of the digits in the product is 16, which is neither
the highest nor the lowest sum so obtainable. Can you find the
solution of the problem that gives the lowest possible sum of digits
in the common product? Also that which gives the highest possible sum?</p>

<p>The Pierrot in the illustration is standing in a posture that
represents the sign of multiplication. He is indicating the peculiar
fact that 15 multiplied by 93 produces exactly the same figures
(1,395), differently arranged. The puzzle is to take any four digits
you like (all different) and similarly arrange them so that the number
formed on one side of the Pierrot when multiplied by the number on the
other side shall produce the same figures. There are very few ways of
doing it, and I shall give all the cases possible. Can you find them
all? You are allowed to put two figures on each side of the Pierrot as
in the example shown, or to place a single figure on one side and
three figures on the other. If we only used three digits instead of
four, the only possible ways are these: 3 multiplied by 51 equals 153,
and 6 multiplied by 21 equals 126.</p>

<p>A London policeman one night saw two cabs drive off in opposite
directions under suspicious circumstances. This officer was a
particularly careful and wide-awake man, and he took out his
pocket-book to make an entry of the numbers of the cabs, but
discovered that he had lost his pencil. Luckily, however, he found a
small piece of chalk, with which he marked the two numbers on the
gateway of a wharf close by. When he returned to the same spot on his
beat he stood and looked again at the numbers, and noticed this
peculiarity, that all the nine digits (no nought) were used and that
no figure was repeated, but that if he multiplied the two numbers
together they again produced the nine digits, all once, and once only.
When one of the clerks arrived at the wharf in the early morning, he
observed the chalk marks and carefully rubbed them out. As the
policeman could not remember them, certain mathematicians were then
consulted as to whether there was any known method for discovering all
the pairs of numbers that have the peculiarity that the officer had
noticed; but they knew of none. The investigation, however, was
interesting, and the following question out of many was proposed: What
two numbers, containing together all the nine digits, will, when
multiplied together, produce another number (the <i>highest possible</i>)
containing also all the nine digits? The nought is not allowed
anywhere.</p>

<p>Where a large number of workmen are employed on a building it is
customary to provide every man with a little disc bearing his number.
These are hung on a board by the men as they arrive, and serve as a
check on punctuality. Now, I once noticed a foreman remove a number of
these checks from his board and place them on a split-ring which he
carried in his pocket. This at once gave me the idea for a good
puzzle. In fact, I will confide to my readers that this is just how

checks on a ring, numbered 1 to 9 and 0. The puzzle is to divide them
into three groups without taking any off the ring, so that the first
group multiplied by the second makes the third group. For example, we
can divide them into the three groups, 2&mdash;8 9 7&mdash;1 5 4 6 3, by
bringing the 6 and the 3 round to the 4, but unfortunately the first
two when multiplied together do not make the third. Can you separate
them correctly? Of course you may have as many of the checks as you
like in any group. The puzzle calls for some ingenuity, unless you
have the luck to hit on the answer by chance.</p>

painted six posts for Tim, and then the job was finished. As there was
an equal number of lamp-posts on each side of the street, the simple
question is: Which man painted the more lamp-posts, and just how many
more?</p>

of sugar-plums. It was quite unexpected loot, and an exciting scramble
ensued, the full details of which I will recount with accuracy, as it
forms an interesting puzzle.</p>

<p>You see, Andrew managed to get possession of just two-thirds of the
parcel of sugar-plums. Bob at once grabbed three-eighths of these, and
Charlie managed to seize three-tenths also. Then young David dashed
upon the scene, and captured all that Andrew had left, except
one-seventh, which Edgar artfully secured for himself by a cunning
trick. Now the fun began in real earnest, for Andrew and Charlie
jointly set upon Bob, who stumbled against the fender and dropped half
of all that he had, which were equally picked up by David and Edgar,
who had crawled under a table and were waiting. Next, Bob sprang on
Charlie from a chair, and upset all the latter's collection on to the
floor. Of this prize Andrew got just a quarter, Bob <span class='pagenum'>Pg 20<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>gathered up
one-third, David got two-sevenths, while Charlie and Edgar divided
equally what was left of that stock.</p>

out in two directions at once, upsetting three-quarters of what Bob
and Andrew had last acquired. The two latter, with the greatest
difficulty, recovered five-eighths of it in equal shares, but the
three others each carried off one-fifth of the same. Every sugar-plum
was now accounted for, and they called a truce, and divided equally
amongst them the remainder of the parcel. What is the smallest number
of sugar-plums there could have been at the start, and what proportion
did each boy obtain?</p>

735-804). Here is a little puzzle from his works, which is at least
interesting on account of its antiquity. "If 100 bushels of corn were
distributed among 100 people in such a manner that each man received
three bushels, each woman two, and each child half a bushel, how many
men, women, and children were there?"</p>

<p>A farmer had a square cornfield. The corn was all ripe for reaping,
and, as he was short of men, it was arranged that he and his son
should share the work between them. The farmer first cut one rod wide
all round the square, thus leaving a smaller square of standing corn
in the middle of the field. "Now," he said to his son, "I have cut my
half of the field, and you can do your share." The son was not quite
satisfied as to the proposed division of labour, and as the village
schoolmaster happened to be passing, he appealed to that person to
decide the matter. He found the farmer was quite correct, provided
there was no dispute as to the size of the field, and on this point
they were agreed. Can you tell the area of the field, as that
ingenious schoolmaster succeeded in doing?</p>

30 added to 25 is 55, and 55 multiplied by 55 is 3025. Curious, is it

the mastering of some little principle upon which a puzzle was built
has proved of considerable value to them in a most unexpected way.
Indeed, it may be accepted as a good maxim that a puzzle is of little
real value unless, as well as being amusing and perplexing, it
conceals some instructive and possibly useful feature. It is, however,
very curious how these little bits of acquired knowledge dovetail into
the occasional requirements of everyday life, and equally curious to
what strange and mysterious uses some of our readers seem to apply
them. What, for example, can be the object of Mr. Wm. Oxley, who
writes to me all the way from Iowa, in wishing to ascertain the
dimensions of a field that he proposes to enclose, containing just as
many acres as there shall be rails in the fence?</p>

many sheep have you altogether?" He was therefore rather surprised at
Longmore's answer, which was as follows: "You can divide my sheep into

uncertainty concerning the details of the ever-memorable battle on

passage in an ancient monkish chronicle that may never receive the
attention that it deserves, and if I am unable to vouch for the
authenticity of the document it will none the less serve to furnish us
with a problem that can hardly fail to interest those of my readers
who have arithmetical predilections. Here is the passage in question.</p>

<p>"The men of Harold stood well together, as their wont was, and formed
sixty and one squares, with a like number of men in every square
thereof, and woe to the hardy Norman who ventured to enter their
redoubts; for a single blow of a Saxon war-hatchet would break his
lance and cut through his coat of mail.... When Harold threw himself
into the fray the Saxons were one mighty square of men, shouting the
battle-cries, 'Ut!' 'Olicrosse!' 'Godemit&egrave;!'"</p>

Saxons did actually fight in this solid order. For example, in the
"Carmen de Bello Hastingensi," a poem attributed to Guy, Bishop of
Amiens, living at the time of the battle, we are told that "the Saxons
stood fixed in a dense mass," and Henry of Huntingdon records that
"they were like unto a castle, impenetrable to the Normans;" while
Robert Wace, a century after, tells us the same thing. So in this
respect my newly-discovered chronicle may not be greatly in error. But
I have reason to believe that there is something wrong with the actual
figures. Let the reader see what he can make of them.</p>

<p>The number of men would be sixty-one times a square number; but when
Harold himself joined in the fray they were then able to form one
large square. What is the smallest possible number of men there could
have been?</p>

<p>In order to make clear to the reader the simplicity of the question, I
will give the lowest solutions in the case of 60 and 62, the numbers
immediately preceding and following 61. They are 60&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 =
31<sup>2</sup>, and 62&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;8<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;63<sup>2</sup>. That is, 60 squares of 16 men
each would be 960 men, and when Harold joined them they would be 961
in number, and so form a square with 31 men on every side. Similarly
in the case of the figures I have given for 62. Now, find the lowest
answer for 61.</p>

<p>An ancient sculptor was commissioned to supply two statues, each on a
cubical pedestal. It is with these pedestals that we are concerned.
They were of unequal sizes, as will be seen in the illustration, and
when the time arrived for <span class='pagenum'>Pg 24<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>payment a dispute arose as to whether the
agreement was based on lineal or cubical measurement. But as soon as
they came to measure the two pedestals the matter was at once settled,
because, curiously enough, the number of lineal feet was exactly the
same as the number of cubical feet. The puzzle is to find the
dimensions for two pedestals having this peculiarity, in the smallest
possible figures. You see, if the two pedestals, for example, measure
respectively 3 ft. and 1 ft. on every side, then the lineal
measurement would be 4 ft. and the cubical contents 28 ft., which are
not the same, so these measurements will not do.</p>

<p>There once lived in a small town in New Castile a noted miser named
Don Manuel Rodriguez. His love of money was only equalled by a strong
passion for arithmetical problems. These puzzles usually dealt in some
way or other with his accumulated treasure, and were propounded by him
solely in order that he might have the pleasure of solving them
himself. Unfortunately very few of them have survived, and when
travelling through Spain, collecting material for a proposed work on
"The Spanish Onion as a Cause of National Decadence," I only
discovered a very few. One of these concerns the three boxes that
appear in the accompanying authentic portrait.</p>

<p>Each box contained a different number of golden doubloons. The
difference between the number of doubloons in the upper box and the
number in the middle box was the same as the difference between the
number in the middle box and the number in the bottom box. And if the
contents of any two of the boxes were united they would form a square
number. What is the smallest number of doubloons that there could have
been in any one of the boxes?</p>

<p>The following puzzle will illustrate the importance on occasions of
being able to fix the minimum and maximum limits of a required number.
This can very frequently be done. For example, it has not yet been
ascertained in how many different ways the knight's tour can be
performed on the chess board; but we know that it is fewer than the
number of combinations of 168 things taken 63 at a time and is greater
than 31,054,144&mdash;for the latter is the number of routes of a
particular type. Or, to take a more familiar case, if you ask a man
how many coins he has in his pocket, he may tell you that he has not
the slightest idea. But on further questioning you will get out of him
some such statement as the following: "Yes, I am positive that I have
more than three coins, and equally certain that there are not so many
as twenty-five." Now, the knowledge that a certain number lies between
2 and 12 in my puzzle will enable the solver to find the exact answer;
without that information there would be an infinite number of answers,
from which it would be impossible to select the correct one.</p>

<p>This is another puzzle received from my friend Don Manuel Rodriguez,
the cranky miser of New Castile. On New Year's Eve in 1879 he showed
me nine treasure boxes, and after informing me that every box
contained a square number of golden doubloons, and that the difference
between the contents of A and B was the same as between B and C, D and
E, E and F, G and H, or H and I, he requested me to tell him the
number of coins in every one of the boxes. At first I thought this was
impossible, as there would be an infinite number of different answers,
but on consideration I found that this was not the case. I discovered
that while every box contained coins, the contents of A, B, C
in<span class='pagenum'>Pg 25<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>creased in weight in alphabetical order; so did D, E, F; and so
did G, H, I; but D or E need not be heavier than C, nor G or H heavier
than F. It was also perfectly certain that box A could not contain
more than a dozen coins at the outside; there might not be half that
number, but I was positive that there were not more than twelve. With
this knowledge I was able to arrive at the correct answer.</p>

<p>In short, we have to discover nine square numbers such that A, B, C;
and D, E, F; and G, H, I are three groups in arithmetical progression,
the common difference being the same in each group, and A being less
than 12. How many doubloons were there in every one of the nine boxes?</p>

band pointed out that if Alfonso had twelve times as much, Benito
three times as much, Carlos the same amount, Diego half as much, and
Esteban one-third as much, they would still have altogether just 200

(died 1559), and he flattered himself that he had found one solution;

<p>A stonemason once had a large number of cubic blocks of stone in his
yard, all of exactly the same size. He had some very fanciful little
ways, and one of his queer notions was to keep these blocks piled in
cubical heaps, no two heaps containing the same number of blocks. He
had discovered for himself (a fact that is well known to
mathematicians) that if he took all the blocks contained in any number
of heaps in regular order, beginning with the single cube, he could
always arrange those on the ground so as to form a perfect square.
This will be clear to the reader, because one block is a square, 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;8
= 9 is a square, 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;+&nbsp;27&nbsp;=&nbsp;36 is a square, 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;+&nbsp;27&nbsp;+&nbsp;64&nbsp;=&nbsp;100 is
a square, and so on. In fact, the sum of any number of consecutive
cubes, beginning always with 1, is in every case a square number.</p>

<p>One day a gentleman entered the mason's yard and offered him a certain
price if he would supply him with a consecutive number of these
cubical heaps which should contain altogether a number of blocks that
could be laid out to form a square, but the buyer insisted on more
than three heaps and <i>declined to take the single block</i> because it
contained a flaw. What was the smallest possible number of blocks of
stone that the mason had to supply?</p>

<p>Certain numbers are called triangular, because if they are taken to
represent counters or coins they may be laid out on the table so as to
form triangles. The number 1 is always regarded as triangular, just as
1 is a square and a cube number. Place one counter on the table&mdash;that
is, the first triangular number. Now place two more counters beneath
it, and you have a triangle of three counters; therefore 3 is
triangular. Next place a row of three more counters, and you have a
triangle of six counters; therefore 6 is triangular. We see that every
row of counters that we add, containing just one more counter than the
row above it, makes a larger triangle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 26<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>Now, half the sum of any number and its square is always a triangular
number. Thus half of 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3; half of 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;3<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;6; half of 4 +
4<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10; half of 5&nbsp;+&nbsp;5<sup>2</sup>= 15; and so on. So if we want to form a
triangle with 8 counters on each side we shall require half of 8 +
8<sup>2</sup>, or 36 counters. This is a pretty little property of numbers.
Before going further, I will here say that if the reader refers to the
"Stonemason's Problem" (No. 135) he will remember that the sum of any
number of consecutive cubes beginning with 1 is always a square, and
these form the series 1<sup>2</sup>, 3<sup>2</sup>, 6<sup>2</sup>, 10<sup>2</sup>, etc. It will now be
understood when I say that one of the keys to the puzzle was the fact
that these are always the squares of triangular numbers&mdash;that is, the
squares of 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, etc., any of which numbers we have
seen will form a triangle.</p>

<p>Every whole number is either triangular, or the sum of two triangular
numbers or the sum of three triangular numbers. That is, if we take
any number we choose we can always form one, two, or three triangles
with them. The number 1 will obviously, and uniquely, only form one
triangle; some numbers will only form two triangles (as 2, 4, 11,
etc.); some numbers will only form three triangles (as 5, 8, 14,
etc.). Then, again, some numbers will form both one and two triangles
(as 6), others both one and three triangles (as 3 and 10), others both
two and three triangles (as 7 and 9), while some numbers (like 21)
will form one, two, or three triangles, as we desire. Now for a little
puzzle in triangular numbers.</p>

<p>Sandy McAllister, of Aberdeen, practised strict domestic economy, and
was anxious to train his good wife in his own habits of thrift. He
told her last New Year's Eve that when she had saved so many
sovereigns that she could lay them all out on the table so as to form
a perfect square, or a perfect triangle, or two triangles, or three
triangles, just as he might choose to ask he would add five pounds to
her treasure. Soon she went to her husband with a little bag of &pound;36 in
sovereigns and claimed her reward. It will be found that the
thirty-six coins will form a square (with side 6), that they will form
a single triangle (with side 8), that they will form two triangles
(with sides 5 and 6), and that they will form three triangles (with
sides 3, 5, and 5). In each of the four cases all the thirty-six coins
are used, as required, and Sandy therefore made his wife the promised
present like an honest man.</p>

<p>The Scotsman then undertook to extend his promise for five more years,
so that if next year the increased number of sovereigns that she has
saved can be laid out in the same four different ways she will receive
a second present; if she succeeds in the following year she will get a
third present, and so on until she has earned six presents in all.
Now, how many sovereigns must she put together before she can win the
sixth present?</p>

<p>What you have to do is to find five numbers, the smallest possible,
higher than 36, that can be displayed in the four ways&mdash;to form a
square, to form a triangle, to form two triangles, and to form three
triangles. The highest of your five numbers will be your answer.</p>

different character. Four married couples went into their village on a

The fact is, Ann spent 1<i>s</i>., Mary spent 2<i>s</i>., Jane spent 3<i>s</i>., and Kate

four times as much as his wife. On the way home somebody suggested

<p>"There is no study," said Augustus de Morgan, "which presents so
simple a beginning as that of geometry; there is none in which
difficulties grow more rapidly as we proceed." This will be found when
the reader comes to consider the following puzzles, though they are
not arranged in strict order of difficulty. And the fact that they
have interested and given pleasure to man for untold ages is no doubt
due in some measure to the appeal they make to the eye as well as to
the brain. Sometimes an algebraical formula or theorem seems to give
pleasure to the mathematician's eye, but it is probably only an
intellectual pleasure. But there can be no doubt that in the case of
certain geometrical problems, notably dissection or superposition
puzzles, the &aelig;sthetic faculty in man contributes to the delight. For
example, there are probably few readers who will examine the various
cuttings of the Greek cross in the following pages without being in
some degree stirred by a sense of beauty. Law and order in Nature are
always pleasing to contemplate, but when they come under the very eye
they seem to make a specially strong appeal. Even the person with no
geometrical knowledge whatever is induced after the inspection of such
things to exclaim, "How very pretty!" In fact, I have known more than
one person led on to a study of geometry by the fascination of
cutting-out puzzles. I have, therefore, thought it well to keep these
dissection puzzles distinct from the geometrical problems on more
general lines.</p>

<p>Puzzles have infinite variety, but perhaps there is no class more
ancient than dissection, cutting-out, or superposition puzzles. They
were certainly known to the Chinese several thousand years before the
Christian era. And they are just as fascinating to-day as they can
have been at any period of their history. It is supposed by those who
have investigated the matter that the ancient Chinese philosophers
used these <span class='pagenum'>Pg 28<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>puzzles as a sort of kindergarten method of imparting the
principles of geometry. Whether this was so or not, it is certain that
all good dissection puzzles (for the nursery type of jig-saw puzzle,
which merely consists in cutting up a picture into pieces to be put
together again, is not worthy of serious consideration) are really
based on geometrical laws. This statement need not, however, frighten
off the novice, for it means little more than this, that geometry will
give us the "reason why," if we are interested in knowing it, though
the solutions may often be discovered by any intelligent person after
the exercise of patience, ingenuity, and common sagacity.</p>

<p>If we want to cut one plane figure into parts that by readjustment
will form another figure, the first thing is to find a way of doing it
at all, and then to discover how to do it in the fewest possible
pieces. Often a dissection problem is quite easy apart from this
limitation of pieces. At the time of the publication in the <i>Weekly
Dispatch</i>, in 1902, of a method of cutting an equilateral triangle
into four parts that will form a square (see No. 26, "Canterbury
Puzzles"), no geometrician would have had any difficulty in doing what
is required in five pieces: the whole point of the discovery lay in
performing the little feat in four pieces only.</p>

<p>Mere approximations in the case of these problems are valueless; the
solution must be geometrically exact, or it is not a solution at all.
Fallacies are cropping up now and again, and I shall have occasion to
refer to one or two of these. They are interesting merely as
fallacies. But I want to say something on two little points that are
always arising in cutting-out puzzles&mdash;the questions of "hanging by a
thread" and "turning over." These points can best be illustrated by a
puzzle that is frequently to be found in the old books, but invariably
with a false solution. The puzzle is to cut the figure shown in Fig. 1
into three pieces that will fit together and form a half-square
triangle. The answer that is invariably given is that shown in Figs. 1
and 2. Now, it is claimed that the four pieces marked C are really
only one piece, because they may be so cut that they are left "hanging
together by a mere thread." But no serious puzzle lover will ever
admit this. If the cut is made so as to leave the four pieces joined
in one, then it cannot result in a perfectly exact solution. If, on
the other hand, the solution is to be exact, then there will be four
pieces&mdash;or six pieces in all. It is, therefore, not a solution in
three pieces.</p>

</div>

<p>If, however, the reader will look at the solution in Figs. 3 and 4, he
will see that no such fault can be found with it. There is no question
whatever that there are three pieces, and the solution is in this
respect quite satisfactory. But another question arises. It will be
found on inspection that the piece marked F, in Fig. 3, is turned over
in Fig. 4&mdash;that is to say, a different side has necessarily to be
presented. If the puzzle were merely to be cut out of cardboard or
wood, there might be no objection to this reversal, but it is quite
possible that the material would not admit of being reversed. There
might be a pattern, a polish, a difference of texture, that prevents
it. But it is generally understood that in dissection puzzles you are
allowed to turn pieces over unless it is distinctly stated that you
may not do so. And very often a puzzle is greatly improved by the
added condition, "no piece may be turned over." I have often made
puzzles, too, in which the diagram has a small repeated pattern, and
the pieces have then so to be cut that not only is there no turning
over, but the pattern has to be matched, which cannot be done if the
pieces are turned round, even with the proper side uppermost.</p>

<p>Before presenting a varied series of cutting-out puzzles, some very
easy and others difficult, I propose to consider one family
alone&mdash;those problems involving what is known as the Greek cross with
the square. This will exhibit a great variety of curious
transpositions, and, by having the solutions as we go along, the
reader will be saved the trouble of perpetually turning to another
part of the book, and will have everything under his eye. It is hoped
that in this way the article may prove somewhat instructive to the
novice and interesting to others.</p>

<p>Many people are accustomed to consider the cross as a wholly Christian
symbol. This is erroneous: it is of very great antiquity. The ancient
Egyptians employed it as a sacred <span class='pagenum'>Pg 29<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>symbol, and on Greek sculptures we
find representations of a cake (the supposed real origin of our hot
cross buns) bearing a cross. Two such cakes were discovered at
Herculaneum. Cecrops offered to Jupiter Olympus a sacred cake or
<i>boun</i> of this kind. The cross and ball, so frequently found on
Egyptian figures, is a circle and the <i>tau</i> cross. The circle
signified the eternal preserver of the world, and the T, named from
the Greek letter <i>tau</i>, is the monogram of Thoth, the Egyptian
Mercury, meaning wisdom. This <i>tau</i> cross is also called by Christians
the cross of St. Anthony, and is borne on a badge in the bishop's
palace at Exeter. As for the Greek or mundane cross, the cross with
four equal arms, we are told by competent antiquaries that it was
regarded by ancient occultists for thousands of years as a sign of the
dual forces of Nature&mdash;the male and female spirit of everything that
was everlasting.</p>

<p>The Greek cross, as shown in Fig. 5, is formed by the assembling
together of five equal squares. We will start with what is known as
the Hindu problem, supposed to be upwards of three thousand years old.
It appears in the seal of Harvard College, and is often given in old
works as symbolical of mathematical science and exactitude. Cut the
cross into five pieces to form a square. Figs. 6 and 7 show how this
is done. It was not until the middle of the nineteenth century that we
found that the cross might be transformed into a square in only four
pieces. Figs. 8 and 9 will show how to do it, if we further require
the four pieces to be all of the same size and shape. This Fig. 9 is
remarkable because, according to Dr. Le Plongeon and others, as
expounded in a work by Professor Wilson of the Smithsonian Institute,
here we have the great Swastika, or sign, of "good luck to you "&mdash;the
most ancient symbol of the human race of which there is any record.
Professor Wilson's work gives some four hundred illustrations of this
curious sign as found in the Aztec mounds of Mexico, the pyramids of
Egypt, the ruins of Troy, and the ancient lore of India and China. One
might almost say there is a curious affinity between the Greek cross
and Swastika! If, however, we require that the four pieces shall be
produced by only two clips of the scissors (assuming the puzzle is in
paper form), then we must cut as in Fig. 10 to form Fig. 11, the first
clip of the scissors being from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>. Of course folding the
paper, or holding the pieces together after the first cut, would not
in this case be allowed. But there is an infinite number of different
ways of making the cuts to solve the puzzle in four pieces. To this
point I propose to return.</p>

</div>

<p>It will be seen that every one of these puzzles has its reverse
puzzle&mdash;to cut a square into pieces to form a Greek cross. But as a
square has not so many angles as the cross, it is not always equally
easy to discover the true directions of the cuts. Yet in the case of
the examples given, I will leave the reader to determine their
direction for himself, as they are rather obvious from the diagrams.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 30<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>Cut a square into five pieces that will form two separate Greek
crosses of <i>different sizes</i>. This is quite an easy puzzle. As will be
seen in Fig. 12, we have only to divide our square into 25 little
squares and then cut as shown. The cross A is cut out entire, and the
pieces B, C, D, and E form the larger cross in Fig. 13. The reader may
here like to cut the single piece, B, into four pieces all similar in
shape to itself, and form a cross with them in the manner shown in
Fig. 13. I hardly need give the solution.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disectiong.png" width="400" height="216" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<p>Cut a square into five pieces that will form two separate Greek
crosses of exactly the <i>same size</i>. This is more difficult. We make
the cuts as in Fig. 14, where the cross A comes out entire and the
other four pieces form the cross in Fig. 15. The direction of the cuts
is pretty obvious. It will be seen that the sides of the square in
Fig. 14 are marked off into six equal parts. The sides of the cross
are found by ruling lines from certain of these points to others.</p>


<p>I will now explain, as I promised, why a Greek cross may be cut into
four pieces in an infinite number of different ways to make a square.
Draw a cross, as in Fig. 16. Then draw on transparent paper the square
shown in Fig. 17, taking care that the distance <i>c</i> to <i>d</i> is exactly
the same as the distance <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> in the cross. Now place the
transparent paper over the cross and slide it about into different
positions, only be very careful always to keep the square at the same
angle to the cross as shown, where <i>a</i> <i>b</i> is parallel to <i>c</i> <i>d</i>. If
you place the point <i>c</i> exactly over <i>a</i> the lines will indicate the
solution (Figs. 10 and 11). If you place <i>c</i> in the very centre of the
dotted square, it will give the solution in Figs. 8 and 9. You will
now see that by sliding the square about so that the point <i>c</i> is
always within the dotted square you may get as many different
solutions as you like; because, since an infinite number of different
points may theoretically be placed within this square, there must be
an infinite number of different solutions. But the point <i>c</i> need not
necessarily be placed within the dotted square. It may be placed, for
example, at point <i>e</i> to give a solution in four pieces. Here the
joins at <i>a</i> and <i>f</i> may be as slender as you like. Yet if you once
get over the edge at <i>a</i> or <i>f</i> you no longer have a solution in four
pieces. This proof will be found both entertaining and instructive. If
you do not happen to have any transparent paper at hand, any thin
paper will of course do if you hold the two sheets against a pane of
glass in the window.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disectionh.png" width="400" height="279" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>It may have been noticed from the solutions of the puzzles that I have
given that the side of the square formed from the cross is always
equal to the distance <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> in Fig. 16. This must necessarily be
so, and I will presently try to make the point quite clear.</p>

<p>We will now go one step further. I have already said that the ideal
solution to a cutting-out puzzle is always that which requires the
fewest possible pieces. We have just seen that two crosses of the same
size may be cut out of a square in five pieces. The reader who
succeeded in solving this perhaps asked himself: "Can it be done in
fewer pieces?" This is just the sort of question that the true puzzle
lover is always asking, and it is the right attitude for him to adopt.
The answer to the question is that the puzzle may be solved in four
pieces&mdash;the fewest possible. This, then, is a new puzzle. Cut a square
into four pieces that will form two Greek crosses of the same size.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disectioni.png" width="400" height="169" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The solution is very beautiful. If you divide by points the sides of
the square into three equal parts, the directions of the lines in Fig.
18 will be quite obvious. If you cut along these lines, <span class='pagenum'>Pg 31<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>the pieces A
and B will form the cross in Fig. 19 and the pieces C and D the
similar cross in Fig. 20. In this square we have another form of
Swastika.</p>

<p>The reader will here appreciate the truth of my remark to the effect
that it is easier to find the directions of the cuts when transforming
a cross to a square than when converting a square into a cross. Thus,
in Figs. 6, 8, and 10 the directions of the cuts are more obvious than
in Fig. 14, where we had first to divide the sides of the square into
six equal parts, and in Fig. 18, where we divide them into three equal
parts. Then, supposing you were required to cut two equal Greek
crosses, each into two pieces, to form a square, a glance at Figs. 19
and 20 will show how absurdly more easy this is than the reverse
puzzle of cutting the square to make two crosses.</p>

<p>Referring to my remarks on "fallacies," I will now give a little
example of these "solutions" that are not solutions. Some years ago a
young correspondent sent me what he evidently thought was a brilliant
new discovery&mdash;the transforming of a square into a Greek cross in four
pieces by cuts all parallel to the sides of the square. I give his
attempt in Figs. 21 and 22, where it will be seen that the four pieces
do not form a symmetrical Greek cross, because the four arms are not
really squares but oblongs. To make it a true Greek cross we should
require the additions that I have indicated with dotted lines. Of
course his solution produces a cross, but it is not the symmetrical
Greek variety required by the conditions of the puzzle. My young
friend thought his attempt was "near enough" to be correct; but if he
bought a penny apple with a sixpence he probably would not have
thought it "near enough" if he had been given only fourpence change.
As the reader advances he will realize the importance of this question
of exactitude.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disectionj.png" width="400" height="251" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p>In these cutting-out puzzles it is necessary not only to get the
directions of the cutting lines as correct as possible, but to
remember that these lines have no width. If after cutting up one of
the crosses in a manner indicated in these articles you find that the
pieces do not exactly fit to form a square, you may be certain that
the fault is entirely your own. Either your cross was not exactly
drawn, or your cuts were not made quite in the right directions, or
(if you used wood and a fret-saw) your saw was not sufficiently fine.
If you cut out the puzzles in paper with scissors, or in cardboard
with a penknife, no material is lost; but with a saw, however fine,
there is a certain loss. In the case of most puzzles this slight loss
is not sufficient to be appreciable, if the puzzle is cut out on a
large scale, but there have been instances where I have found it
desirable to draw and cut out each part separately&mdash;not from one
diagram&mdash;in order to produce a perfect result.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disectionk.png" width="400" height="213" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now for another puzzle. If you have cut out the five pieces indicated
in Fig. 14, you will find that these can be put together so as to form
the curious cross shown in Fig. 23. So if I asked you to cut Fig. 24
into five pieces to form either a square or two equal Greek crosses
you would know how to do it. You would make the cuts as in Fig. 23,
and place them together as in Figs. 14 and 15. But I want something
better than that, and it is this. Cut Fig. 24 into only four pieces
that will fit together and form a square.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disectionl.png" width="400" height="208" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The solution to the puzzle is shown in Figs. 25 and 26. The direction
of the cut dividing A and C in the first diagram is very obvious, and
the second cut is made at right angles to it. That the four pieces
should fit together and form a square will surprise the novice, who
will do well to study the puzzle with some care, as it is most
instructive.</p>

<p>I will now explain the beautiful rule by which we determine the size
of a square that shall have the same area as a Greek cross, for it is
applicable, and necessary, to the solution of almost every dissection
puzzle that we meet with. It was first discovered by the philosopher
Pythagoras, who died 500 B.C., and is the 47th proposition of Euclid.
The young reader who knows nothing of the elements of geometry will
get some idea of the fascinating character of that science. The
triangle ABC in Fig. 27 is what we call a right-angled triangle,
because the side BC is at right angles to the side AB. Now if we build
up a square on each side of the tri<span class='pagenum'>Pg 32<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>angle, the squares on AB and BC
will together be exactly equal to the square on the long side AC,
which we call the hypotenuse. This is proved in the case I have given
by subdividing the three squares into cells of equal dimensions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disectionm.png" width="400" height="213" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>It will be seen that 9 added to 16 equals 25, the number of cells in
the large square. If you make triangles with the sides 5, 12 and 13,
or with 8, 15 and 17, you will get similar arithmetical proofs, for
these are all "rational" right-angled triangles, but the law is
equally true for all cases. Supposing we cut off the lower arm of a
Greek cross and place it to the left of the upper arm, as in Fig. 28,
then the square on EF added to the square on DE exactly equals a
square on DF. Therefore we know that the square of DF will contain the
same area as the cross. This fact we have proved practically by the
solutions of the earlier puzzles of this series. But whatever length
we give to DE and EF, we can never give the exact length of DF in
numbers, because the triangle is not a "rational" one. But the law is
none the less geometrically true.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disectionn.png" width="400" height="198" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now look at Fig. 29, and you will see an elegant method for cutting a
piece of wood of the shape of two squares (of any relative dimensions)
into three pieces that will fit together and form a single square. If
you mark off the distance <i>ab</i> equal to the side <i>cd</i> the directions
of the cuts are very evident. From what we have just been considering,
you will at once see why <i>bc</i> must be the length of the side of the
new square. Make the experiment as often as you like, taking different
relative proportions for the two squares, and you will find the rule
always come true. If you make the two squares of exactly the same
size, you will see that the diagonal of any square is always the side
of a square that is twice the size. All this, which is so simple that
anybody can understand it, is very essential to the solving of
cutting-out puzzles. It is in fact the key to most of them. And it is
all so beautiful that it seems a pity that it should not be familiar
to everybody.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disectiono.png" width="400" height="250" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>We will now go one step further and deal with the half-square. Take a
square and cut it in half diagonally. Now try to discover how to cut
this triangle into four pieces that will form a Greek cross. The
solution is shown in Figs. 31 and 32. In this case it will be seen
that we divide two of the sides of the triangle into three equal parts
and the long side into four equal parts. Then the direction of the
cuts will be easily found. It is a pretty puzzle, and a little more
difficult than some of the others that I have given. It should be
noted again that it would have been much easier to locate the cuts in
the reverse puzzle of cutting the cross to form a half-square
triangle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disectionp.png" width="400" height="230" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Another ideal that the puzzle maker always keeps in mind is to
contrive that there shall, if possible, be only one correct solution.
Thus, in the case of the first puzzle, if we only require that a Greek
cross shall be cut into four pieces to form a square, there is, as I
have shown, an infinite number of different solutions. It makes a
better puzzle to add the condition that all the four pieces shall be
of the same size and shape, because it can then be solved in only one
way, as in Figs. 8 and 9. In this way, too, a puzzle that is too easy
to be interesting may be improved by such an addition. Let us take an
example. We have seen in Fig. 28 that Fig. 33 can be cut into two
pieces to form a Greek cross. I suppose an intelligent child would do
it in five minutes. But suppose we say that the puzzle has to be
solved with a piece of wood that has <span class='pagenum'>Pg 33<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>a bad knot in the position shown
in Fig. 33&mdash;a knot that we must not attempt to cut through&mdash;then a
solution in two pieces is barred out, and it becomes a more
interesting puzzle to solve it in three pieces. I have shown in Figs.
33 and 34 one way of doing this, and it will be found entertaining to
discover other ways of doing it. Of course I could bar out all these
other ways by introducing more knots, and so reduce the puzzle to a
single solution, but it would then be overloaded with conditions.</p>

<p>And this brings us to another point in seeking the ideal. Do not
overload your conditions, or you will make your puzzle too complex to
be interesting. The simpler the conditions of a puzzle are, the
better. The solution may be as complex and difficult as you like, or
as happens, but the conditions ought to be easily understood, or
people will not attempt a solution.</p>

<p>If the reader were now asked "to cut a half-square into as few pieces
as possible to form a Greek cross," he would probably produce our
solution, Figs. 31-32, and confidently claim that he had solved the
puzzle correctly. In this way he would be wrong, because it is not now
stated that the square is to be divided diagonally. Although we should
always observe the exact conditions of a puzzle we must not read into
it conditions that are not there. Many puzzles are based entirely on
the tendency that people have to do this.</p>

<p>The very first essential in solving a puzzle is to be sure that you
understand the exact conditions. Now, if you divided your square in
half so as to produce Fig. 35 it is possible to cut it into as few as
three pieces to form a Greek cross. We thus save a piece.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disectionq.png" width="400" height="263" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>I give another puzzle in Fig. 36. The dotted lines are added merely to
show the correct proportions of the figure&mdash;a square of 25 cells with
the four corner cells cut out. The puzzle is to cut this figure into
five pieces that will form a Greek cross (entire) and a square.</p>

<p>The solution to the first of the two puzzles last given&mdash;to cut a
rectangle of the shape of a half-square into three pieces that will
form a Greek cross&mdash;is shown in Figs. 37 and 38. It will be seen that
we divide the long sides of the oblong into six equal parts and the
short sides into three equal parts, in order to get the points that
will indicate the direction of the cuts. The reader should compare
this solution with some of the previous illustrations. He will see,
for example, that if we continue the cut that divides B and C in the
cross, we get Fig. 15.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disectionr.png" width="400" height="257" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The other puzzle, like the one illustrated in Figs. 12 and 13, will
show how useful a little arithmetic may sometimes prove to be in the
solution of dissection puzzles. There are twenty-one of those little
square cells into which our figure is subdivided, from which we have
to form both a square and a Greek cross. Now, as the cross is built up
of five squares, and 5 from 21 leaves 16&mdash;a square number&mdash;we ought
easily to be led to the solution shown in Fig. 39. It will be seen
that the cross is cut out entire, while the four remaining pieces form
the square in Fig. 40.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disections.png" width="400" height="211" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Of course a half-square rectangle is the same as a double square, or
two equal squares joined together. Therefore, if you want to solve the
puzzle of cutting a Greek cross into four pieces to form two separate
squares of the same size, all you have to do is to continue the short
cut in Fig. 38 right across the cross, and you will have four pieces
of the same size and shape. Now divide Fig. 37 into two equal squares
by a horizontal cut midway and you will see the four pieces forming
the two squares.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/disectiont.png" width="300" height="338" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 34<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>Cut a Greek cross into five
pieces that will form two separate squares, one of which shall contain
half the area of one of the arms of the cross. In further illustration
of what I have already written, if the two squares of the same size A
B C D and B C F E, in Fig. 41, are cut in the manner indicated by the
dotted lines, the four pieces will form the large square A G E C. We
thus see that the diagonal A C is the side of a square twice the size
of A B C D. It is also clear that half the diagonal of any square is
equal to the side of a square of half the area. Therefore, if the
large square in the diagram is one of the arms of your cross, the
small square is the size of one of the squares required in the
puzzle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/disectionu.png" width="400" height="237" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<p>The solution is shown in Figs. 42 and 43. It will be seen that the
small square is cut out whole and the large square composed of the
four pieces B, C, D, and E. After what I have written, the reader will
have no difficulty in seeing that the square A is half the size of one
of the arms of the cross, because the length of the diagonal of the
former is clearly the same as the side of the latter. The thing is now
self-evident. I have thus tried to show that some of these puzzles
that many people are apt to regard as quite wonderful and bewildering,
are really not difficult if only we use a little thought and judgment.
In conclusion of this particular subject I will give four Greek cross
puzzles, with detached solutions.</p>

<p>The lady members of the Wilkinson family had made a simple patchwork
quilt, as a small Christmas present, all composed of square pieces of
the same size, as shown in the illustration. It only lacked the four
corner pieces to make it complete. Somebody pointed out to them that
if you unpicked the Greek cross in the middle and then cut the
stitches along the dark joins, the four pieces all of the same size
and shape would fit together and form a square. This the reader knows,
from the solution in Fig. 39, is quite easily done. But George
Wilkinson suddenly suggested to them this poser. He said, "Instead of
picking out the cross entire, and forming the square from four equal
pieces, can you cut out a square entire and four equal pieces that
will form a perfect Greek cross?" The puzzle is, of course, now quite
easy.</p>

<p>We are told first to cut oft the pieces 1 and 2 and pack them into the
triangular space marked off by the dotted line, and so form a
rectangle.</p>

<p>So far, so good. Now, we are directed to apply the old step principle,
as shown, and, by moving down the piece 4 one step, form the required
square. But, unfortunately, it does <i>not</i> produce a square: only an
oblong. Call the three long sides of the mitre 84 in. each. Then,
before cutting the steps, our rectangle in three pieces will be 84&times;63.
The steps must be 10½ in. in height and 12 in. in breadth.
Therefore, by moving down a step we reduce by 12 in. the side 84 in.
and increase by 10½ in. the side 63 in. Hence our final rectangle
must be 72 in.&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;73½ in., which certainly is not a square! The fact
is, the step principle can only be applied to rectangles with sides of
particular relative lengths. For example, if the shorter side in this
case were 61<sup>5</sup>/<sub>7</sub> (instead of 63), then the step method would apply.
For the steps would then be 10<sup>2</sup>/<sub>7</sub> in. in height and 12 in. in
breadth. Note that 61<sup>5</sup>/<sub>7</sub>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;84= the square of 72. At present no
solution has been found in four pieces, and I do not believe one
possible.</p>

<p>I wonder how many of my readers, amongst those who have not given any
close attention to the elements of geometry, could draw a regular
pentagon, or five-sided figure, if they suddenly required to do so. A
regular hexagon, or six-sided figure, is easy enough, for everybody
knows that all you have to do is to describe a circle and then, taking
the radius as the length of one of the sides, mark off the six points
round the circumference. But a pentagon is quite another matter. So,
as my puzzle has to do with the cutting up of a regular pentagon, it
will perhaps be well if I first show my less experienced readers how
this figure is to be correctly drawn. Describe a circle and draw the
two lines H B and D G, in the diagram, through the centre at right
angles. Now find the point A, midway between C and B. Next place the
point of your compasses at A and with <span class='pagenum'>Pg 38<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>the distance A D describe the
arc cutting H B at E. Then place the point of your compasses at D and
with the distance D E describe the arc cutting the circumference at F.
Now, D F is one of the sides of your pentagon, and you have simply to
mark off the other sides round the circle. Quite simple when you know
how, but otherwise somewhat of a poser.</p>

<p>I have frequently had occasion to show that the published answers to a
great many of the oldest and most widely known puzzles are either
quite incorrect or capable of improvement. I propose to consider the
old poser of the table-top and stools that most of my readers have
probably seen in some form or another in books compiled for the
recreation of childhood.</p>

<p>The story is told that an economical and ingenious schoolmaster once
wished to convert a circular table-top, for which he had no use, into
seats for two oval stools, each with a hand-hole in the centre. He
instructed the carpenter to make the cuts as in the illustration and
then join the eight pieces together in the manner shown. So impressed
was he with the ingenuity of his performance that he set the puzzle to
his geometry class as a little study in dissection. But the remainder
of the story has never been published, because, so it is said, it was
a characteristic of the principals of academies that they would never
admit that they could err. I get my information from a de<span class='pagenum'>Pg 39<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>scendant of
the original boy who had most reason to be interested in the matter.</p>

<p>The clever youth suggested modestly to the master that the hand-holes
were too big, and that a small boy might perhaps fall through them. He
therefore proposed another way of making the cuts that would get over
this objection. For his impertinence he received such severe
chastisement that he became convinced that the larger the hand-hole in
the stools the more comfortable might they be.</p>

that will fit together and form two oval seats for stools (each of
exactly the same size and shape) and each having similar hand-holes of
smaller dimensions than in the case shown above? Of course, all the
wood must be used.</p>

<p>Here is a symbol of tremendous antiquity which is worthy of notice. It
is borne on the Korean ensign and merchant flag, and has been adopted
as a trade sign by the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, though
probably few are aware that it is the Great Monad, as shown in the
sketch below. This sign is to the Chinaman what the cross is to the
Christian. It is the sign of Deity and eternity, while the two parts
into which the circle is divided are called the Yin and the Yan&mdash;the
male and female forces of nature. A writer on the subject more than
three thousand years ago is reported to have said in reference to it:
"The illimitable produces the great extreme. The great extreme
produces the two principles. The two principles produce the four
quarters, and from the four quarters we develop the quadrature of the
eight diagrams of Feuh-hi." I hope readers will not ask me to explain
this, for I have not the slightest idea what it means. Yet I am
persuaded that for ages the symbol has had occult and probably
mathematical meanings for the esoteric student.</p>

<p>I will introduce the Monad in its elementary form. Here are three easy
questions respecting this great symbol:&mdash;</p>

<p>(I.) Which has the greater area, the inner circle containing the Yin
and the Yan, or the outer ring?</p>

<p>(II.) Divide the Yin and the Yan into four pieces of the same size and
shape by one cut.</p>

<p>(III.) Divide the Yin and the Yan into four pieces of the same size,
but different shape, by one straight cut.</p>

<p>Why horseshoes should be considered "lucky" is one of those things
which no man can understand. It is a very old superstition, and John
Aubrey (1626-1700) says, "Most houses at the West End of London have a
horseshoe on the threshold." In Monmouth Street there were seventeen
in 1813 and seven so late as 1855. Even Lord Nelson had one nailed to
the mast of the ship <i>Victory</i>. To-day we find it more conducive to
"good luck" to see that they are securely nailed on the feet of the
horse we are about to drive.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, so far as the horseshoe, like the Swastika and other
emblems that I have had occasion at times to deal with, has served to
symbolize health, prosperity, and goodwill towards men, we may well
treat it with a certain amount of respectful interest. May there not,
moreover, be some esoteric or lost mathematical mystery concealed in
the form of a horseshoe? I have been looking into this matter, and I
wish to draw my readers' attention to the very remarkable fact that
the pair of horseshoes shown in my illustration are related in a
striking and beautiful manner to the circle, which is the symbol of
eternity. I present this fact in the form of a simple problem, so that
it may be seen how subtly this relation has been concealed for ages
and ages. My readers will, I know, be pleased when they find the key
to the mystery.</p>

<p>This box will be found to serve excellently for the production of
vortex rings. These rings, <span class='pagenum'>Pg 41<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>which were discussed by Von Helmholtz in
1858, are most interesting, and the box (with the hole cut out) will
produce them to perfection. Fill the box with tobacco smoke by blowing
it gently through the hole. Now, if you hold it horizontally, and
softly tap the side that is opposite to the hole, an immense number of
perfect rings can be produced from one mouthful of smoke. It is best
that there should be no currents of air in the room. People often do
not realise that these rings are formed in the air when no smoke is
used. The smoke only makes them visible. Now, one of these rings, if
properly directed on its course, will travel across the room and put
out the flame of a candle, and this feat is much more striking if you
can manage to do it without the smoke. Of course, with a little
practice, the rings may be blown from the mouth, but the box produces
them in much greater perfection, and no skill whatever is required.
Lord Kelvin propounded the theory that matter may consist of vortex
rings in a fluid that fills all space, and by a development of the
hypothesis he was able to explain chemical combination.</p>

<p>Here is a little puzzle that was put to one of the sons of Erin the
other day and perplexed him unduly, for it is really quite easy. It
will be seen from the illustration that he was shown a sketch of a
square pen containing seven pigs. He was asked how he would intersect
the pen with three straight fences so as to enclose every pig in a
separate sty. In other words, all you have to do is to take your
pencil and, with three straight strokes across the square, enclose
each pig separately. Nothing could be simpler.</p>

<p>The Irishman complained that the pigs would not keep still while he
was putting up the fences. He said that they would all flock together,
or one obstinate beast would go into a corner and flock all by
himself. It was pointed out to him that for the purposes of the puzzle
the pigs were stationary. He answered that Irish pigs are not
stationery&mdash;they are pork. Being persuaded to make the attempt, he
drew three lines, one of which cut through a pig. When it was
explained that this is not allowed, he protested <span class='pagenum'>Pg 42<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>that a pig was no
use until you cut its throat. "Begorra, if it's bacon ye want without
cutting your pig, it will be all gammon." We will not do the Irishman
the injustice of suggesting that the miserable pun was intentional.
However, he failed to solve the puzzle. Can you do it?</p>

<p>The landowner in the illustration is consulting with his bailiff over
a rather puzzling little question. He has a large plan of one of his
fields, in which there are eleven trees. Now, he wants to divide the
field into just eleven enclosures by means of straight fences, so that
every enclosure shall contain one tree as a shelter for his cattle.
How is he to do it with as few fences as possible? Take your pencil
and draw straight lines across the field until you have marked off the
eleven enclosures (and no more), and then see how many fences you
require. Of course the fences may cross one another.</p>

<p>Many pastimes of great antiquity, such as chess, have so developed and
changed down the centuries that their original inventors would
scarcely recognize them. This is not the case with Tangrams, a
recreation that appears to be at least four thousand years old, that
has apparently never been dormant, and that has not been altered or
"improved upon" since the legendary Chinaman Tan first cut out the
seven pieces shown in Diagram I. If you mark the point B, midway
between A and C, on one side of a square of any size, and D, midway
between C and E, on an adjoining side, the direction of the cuts is
too obvious to need further explanation. Every design in this article
is built up from the seven pieces of blackened cardboard. It will at
once be understood that the possible combinations are infinite.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/q169a.png" width="300" height="252" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The late Mr. Sam Loyd, of New York, who published a small book of very
ingenious designs, possessed the manuscripts of the late Mr.
Challenor, who made a long and close study of Tangrams. This
gentleman, it is said, records that there were originally seven books
of Tangrams, compiled in China two thousand years before the Christian
era. These books are so rare that, after forty years' residence in the
country, he only succeeded in seeing perfect copies of the first and
seventh volumes with fragments of the second. Portions of one of the
books, printed in gold leaf upon parchment, were found in Peking by an
English soldier and sold for three hundred pounds.</p>

<p>A few years ago a little book came into my possession, from the
library of the late Lewis Carroll, entitled <i>The Fashionable Chinese
Puzzle</i>. It contains three hundred and twenty-three Tangram designs,
mostly nondescript geometrical figures, to be constructed from the
seven pieces. It was "Published by J. and E. Wallis, 42 Skinner
Street, and J. Wallis, Jun., Marine Library, Sidmouth" (South Devon).
There is no date, but the following note fixes the time of publication
pretty closely: "This ingenious contrivance has for some time past
been the favourite amusement of the ex-Emperor Napoleon, who, being
now in a debilitated state and living very retired, passes many hours
a day in thus exercising his patience and ingenuity." The reader will
find, as did the great exile, that much amusement, not wholly
uninstructive, may be derived from forming the designs of others. He
will find many of the illustrations to this article quite easy to
build up, and some rather difficult. Every picture may thus be
regarded as a puzzle.</p>

<p>But it is another pastime altogether to create new and original
designs of a pictorial character, and it is surprising what
extraordinary scope the Tangrams afford for producing pictures of real
life&mdash;angular and often grotesque, it is true, but full of character.
I give an example of a recumbent figure (2) that is particularly
graceful, and only needs some slight reduction of its angularities to
produce an entirely satisfactory outline.</p>

my designs of the March <span class='pagenum'>Pg 44<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>Hare (3) and the Hatter (4). I also give an
attempt at Napoleon (5), and a very excellent Red Indian with his
Squaw by Mr. Loyd (6 and 7). A large number of other designs will be
found in an article by me in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> for November, 1908.</p>

<p>On the appearance of this magazine article, the late Sir James Murray,
the eminent philologist, tried, with that amazing industry that
characterized all his work, to trace the word "tangram" to its source.
At length he wrote as follows:&mdash;"One of my sons is a professor in the
Anglo-Chinese college at Tientsin. Through him, his colleagues, and
his students, I was able to make inquiries as to the alleged Tan among
Chinese scholars. Our Chinese professor here (Oxford) also took an
interest in the matter and obtained information from the secretary of
the Chinese Legation in London, who is a very eminent representative
of the Chinese literati."</p>

<p>"The result has been to show that the man Tan, the god Tan, and the
'Book of Tan' are entirely unknown to Chinese literature, history, or
tradition. By most of the learned men the name, or allegation of the
existence, of these had never been heard of. The puzzle is, of course,
well known. It is called in Chinese <i>ch'i ch'iao t'u</i>; literally,
'seven-ingenious-plan' or 'ingenious-puzzle figure of seven pieces.'
No name approaching 'tangram,' or even 'tan,' occurs in Chinese, and
the only suggestions for the latter were the Chinese <i>t'an</i>, 'to
extend'; or <i>t'ang</i>, Cantonese dialect for 'Chinese.' It was suggested
that probably some American or Englishman who knew a little Chinese or
Cantonese, wanting a name for the puzzle, might concoct one out of one
of these words and the European ending 'gram.' I should say the name
'tangram' was probably invented by an American some little time before
1864 and after 1847, but I cannot find it in print before the 1864
edition of Webster. I have therefore had to deal very shortly with the
word in the dictionary, telling what it is applied to and what
conjectures or guesses have been made at the name, and giving a few
quotations, one from your own article, which has enabled me to make
more of the subject than I could otherwise have done."</p>

<p>Several correspondents have informed me that they possess, or had
possessed, specimens of the old Chinese books. An American gentleman
writes to me as follows:&mdash;"I have in my possession a book made of
tissue paper, printed in black (with a Chinese inscription on the
front page), containing over three hundred designs, which belongs to
the box of 'tangrams,' which I also own. The blocks are seven in
number, made of mother-of-pearl, highly polished and finely engraved
on either side. These are contained in a rosewood box 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>
in. square. My great uncle, &mdash;&mdash;, was one of the first missionaries to
visit China. This box and book, along with quite a collection of other
relics, were sent to my grandfather and descended to myself."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/q169e.png" width="400" height="314" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>My correspondent kindly supplied me with rubbings of the Tangrams,
from which it is clear that they are cut in the exact proportions that
I have indicated. I reproduce the Chinese inscription (8) for this
reason. The owner of the book informs me that he has submitted it to a
number of Chinamen in the United States and offered as much as a
dollar for a translation. But they all steadfastly refused to read the
words, offering the lame excuse that the inscription is Japanese.
Natives of Japan, however, insist that it is Chinese. Is there
something occult and esoteric about Tangrams, that <span class='pagenum'>Pg 45<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>it is so difficult
to lift the veil? Perhaps this page will come under the eye of some
reader acquainted with the Chinese language, who will supply the
required translation, which may, or may not, throw a little light on
this curious question.</p>

<p>By using several sets of Tangrams at the same time we may construct
more ambitious pictures. I was advised by a friend not to send my
picture, "A Game of Billiards" (9), to the Academy. He assured me that
it would not be accepted because the "judges are so hide-bound by
convention." Perhaps he was right, and it will be more appreciated by
Post-impressionists and Cubists. The players are considering a very
delicate stroke at the top of the table. Of course, the two men, the
table, and the clock are formed from four sets of Tangrams. My second
picture is named "The Orchestra" (10), and it was designed for the
decoration of a large hall of music. Here we have the conductor, the
pianist, the fat little cornet-player, the left-handed player of the
double-bass, whose attitude is life-like, though he does stand at an
unusual distance from his instrument, and the drummer-boy, with his
imposing music-stand. The dog at the back of the pianoforte is not
howling: he is an appreciative listener.</p>

</div>

<p>One remarkable thing about these Tangram pictures is that they suggest
to the imagination such a lot that is not really there. Who, for
example, can look for a few minutes at Lady Belinda (11) and the Dutch
girl (12) without soon feeling the haughty expression in the one case
and the arch look in the other? Then look again at the stork (13), and
see how it is suggested to the mind that the leg is actually much more
slender than any one of the pieces employed. It is really an optical
illusion. Again, notice in the case of the yacht (14) how, by leaving
that little angular point at the top, a complete mast is suggested. If
you place your Tangrams together on white paper so that they do not
quite touch one another, in some cases the effect is improved by the
white lines; in other cases it is almost destroyed.</p>

<p>Finally, I give an example from the many curious paradoxes that one
happens upon in manipulating Tangrams. I show designs of <span class='pagenum'>Pg 46<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>two
dignified individuals (15 and 16) who appear to be exactly alike,
except for the fact that one has a foot and the other has not. Now,
both of these figures are made from the same seven Tangrams. Where
does the second man get his foot from?</p>

<p>A Lady had a square piece of bunting with two lions on it, of which

the stuff into pieces that would fit together and form two square
banners with a lion on each banner. She discovered that this could be
done in as few as four pieces. How did she manage it? Of course, to
cut the British Lion would be an unpardonable offence, so you must be
careful that no cut passes through any portion of either of them.
Ladies are informed that no allowance whatever has to be made for
"turnings," and no part of the material may be wasted. It is quite a
simple little dissection puzzle if rightly attacked. Remember that the
banners have to be perfect squares, though they need not be both of

<p>Mrs. Smiley's expression of pleasure was sincere when her six
granddaughters sent to her, as a Christmas present, a very pretty
patchwork quilt, which they had made with their own hands. It was
constructed of square pieces of silk material, all of one size, and as
they made a large quilt with fourteen of these little squares on each
side, it is obvious that just 196 pieces had been stitched into it.
Now, the six granddaughters each contributed a part of the work in the
form of a perfect square (all six portions being different in size),
but in order to join them up to form the square quilt it was necessary
that the work of one girl should be unpicked into three separate
pieces. Can you show how the joins might have been made? Of course, no
portion can be turned over.</p>

<p>Two men broke into a church tower one night to steal the bell-ropes.
The two ropes passed through holes in the wooden ceiling high above
them, and they lost no time in climbing to the top. Then one man drew
his knife and cut the rope above his head, in consequence of which he
fell to the floor and was badly injured. His fellow-thief called out
that it served him right for being such a fool. He said that he should
have done as he was doing, upon which he cut the rope below the place
at which he held on. Then, to his dismay, he found that he was in no
better plight, for, after hanging on as long as his strength lasted,
he was compelled to let go and fall beside his comrade. Here they were
both found the next morning with their limbs broken. How far did they
fall? One of the ropes when they found it was just touching the floor,
and when you pulled the end to the wall, keeping the rope taut, it
touched a point just three inches above the floor, and the wall was
four feet from the rope when it hung at rest. How long was the rope
from floor to ceiling?</p>

<p>Readers will recognize the diagram as a familiar friend of their
youth. A man possessed a square-shaped estate. He bequeathed to his
widow the quarter of it that is shaded off. The remainder was to be
divided equitably amongst his four sons, so that each should receive
land of exactly the same area and exactly similar in shape. We are
shown how this was done. But the remainder of the story is not so
generally known. In the centre of the estate was a well, indicated by
the dark spot, and Benjamin, Charles, and David complained that the
division was not "equitable," since Alfred had access to this well,
while they could not reach it without trespassing on somebody else's
land. The puzzle is to show how the estate is to be apportioned so
that each son shall have land of the same shape and area, and each
have access to the well without going off his own land.</p>

on; and if I changed at Appleford and went thirteen miles from there
to Carterton, it would still be the same distance. You see, I am

other side of the field is the dairy where the extract has to be
deposited. But it has been noticed that the young woman always goes
down to the river with her pail before returning to the dairy. Here
the suspicious reader will perhaps ask why she pays these visits to

and when I met him some days afterwards he exhibited his proficiency
in the art. But he was a little taken aback when I then took the
puzzle from him and, while simply holding the medal between the finger

solid throughout, and that no allowance has to be made for the axle
that passes through it. With that simplification, I wonder how many

<p>There are some curious facts concerning the movements of wheels that
are apt to perplex the novice. For example: when a railway train is
travelling from London to Crewe certain parts of the train at any
given moment are actually moving from Crewe towards London. Can you
indicate those parts? It seems absurd that parts of the same train
can at any time travel in opposite directions, but such is the case.</p>

<p>In the accompanying illustration we have two wheels. The lower one is
supposed to be fixed and the upper one running round it in the
direction of the arrows. Now, how many times does the upper wheel turn
on its own axis in making a complete revolution of the other wheel? Do
not be in a hurry with your answer, or you are almost certain to be
wrong. Experiment with two pennies on the table and the correct answer
will surprise you, when you succeed in seeing it.</p>

enclose two spaces, one just twice as large as the other. Can you
rearrange them (1) so as to enclose two four-sided spaces, one exactly
three times as large as the other, and (2) so as to enclose two
five-sided spaces, one exactly three times as large as the other? All
the eighteen matches must be fairly used in each case; the two spaces
must be quite detached, and there must be no loose ends or duplicated

have been so placed that they enclose six sheep-pens all of the same
size. Now, one of these hurdles was stolen, and the farmer wanted
still to enclose six pens of equal size with the remaining twelve. How
was he to do it? All the twelve matches must be fairly used, and there

<p>What are known as "Points and Lines" puzzles are found very
interesting by many people. The most familiar example, here given, to
plant nine trees so that they shall form ten straight rows with three
trees in every row, is attributed to Sir Isaac Newton, but the
earliest collection of such puzzles is, I believe, in a rare little
book that I possess&mdash;published in 1821&mdash;<i>Rational Amusement for Winter
Evenings</i>, by John Jackson. The author gives ten examples of "Trees
planted in Rows."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p>These tree-planting puzzles have always been a matter of great
perplexity. They are real "puzzles," in the truest sense of the word,
because nobody has yet succeeded in finding a direct and certain way
of solving them. They demand the exercise of sagacity, ingenuity, and
patience, and what we call "luck" is also sometimes of service.
Perhaps some day a genius will discover the key to the whole mystery.
Remember that the trees must be regarded as mere points, for if we
were allowed to make our trees big enough we might easily "fudge" our
diagrams and get in a few extra straight rows that were more apparent
than real.</p>

<p>There was once, in ancient times, a powerful king, who had eccentric
ideas on the subject of military architecture. He held that there was
great strength and economy in symmetrical forms, and always cited the
example of the bees, who construct their combs in perfect hexagonal
cells, to prove that he had nature to support him. He resolved to
build ten new castles in his country all to be connected by fortified
walls, which should form five lines with four castles in every line.
The royal architect presented his preliminary plan in the form I have
shown. But the monarch pointed out that every castle could be
approached from the outside, and commanded that the plan should be so
modified that as many castles as possible should be free from attack
from the outside, and could only be reached by crossing the fortified
walls. The architect replied that he thought it impossible so to
arrange them that even one castle, which the king proposed to use as a
royal residence, could be so protected, but his majesty soon
enlightened him by pointing out how it might be done. How would you
have built the ten castles and fortifications so as best to fulfil the
king's requirements? Remember that they must form five straight lines
with four castles in every line.</p>

<p>The illustration is a plan of a cottage as it stands surrounded by an
orchard of fifty-five trees. Ten of these trees are cherries, ten are
plums, and the remainder apples. The cherries are so planted as to
form five straight lines, with four cherry trees in every line. The
plum trees <span class='pagenum'>Pg 57<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>are also planted so as to form five straight lines with
four plum trees in every line. The puzzle is to show which are the ten
cherry trees and which are the ten plums. In order that the cherries
and plums should have the most favourable aspect, as few as possible
(under the conditions) are planted on the north and east sides of the
orchard. Of course in picking out a group of ten trees (cherry or
plum, as the case may be) you ignore all intervening trees. That is to
say, four trees may be in a straight line irrespective of other trees
(or the house) being in between. After the last puzzle this will be
quite easy.</p>

"I cannot do't without counters."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>Winter's Tale</i>, iv. 3.<br /></span>
</p>

<p>Puzzles of this class, except so far as they occur in connection with
actual games, such as chess, seem to be a comparatively modern
introduction. Mathematicians in recent times, notably Vandermonde and
Reiss, have devoted some attention to them, but they do not appear to
have been considered by the old writers. So far as games with counters
are concerned, perhaps the most ancient and widely known in old times
is "Nine Men's Morris" (known also, as I shall show, under a great
many other names), unless the simpler game, distinctly mentioned in
the works of Ovid (No. 110, "Ovid's Game," in <i>The Canterbury
Puzzles</i>), from which "Noughts and Crosses" seems to be derived, is
still more ancient.</p>

<p>In France the game is called Marelle, in Poland Siegen Wulf Myll
(She-goat Wolf Mill, or Fight), in Germany and Austria it is called
Muhle (the Mill), in Iceland it goes by the name of Mylla, while the
Bogas (or native bargees) of South America are said to play it, and on
the Amazon it is called Trique, and held to be of Indian origin. In
our own country it has different names in different districts, such as
Meg Merrylegs, Peg Meryll, Nine Peg o'Merryal, Nine-Pin Miracle, Merry
Peg, and Merry Hole. Shakespeare refers to it in "Midsummer Night's
Dream" (Act ii., scene 1):&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The nine-men's morris is filled up with mud;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">For lack of tread, are undistinguishable."</span><br />
</p>

<p>It was played by the shepherds with stones in holes cut in the turf.
John Clare, the peasant poet of Northamptonshire, in "The Shepherd
Boy" (1835) says:&mdash;"Oft we track his haunts .... By nine-peg-morris
nicked upon the green." It is also mentioned by Drayton in his
"Polyolbion."</p>

<p>It was found on an old Roman tile discovered during the excavations at
Silchester, and cut upon the steps of the Acropolis at Athens. When
visiting the Christiania Museum a few years ago I was shown the great
Viking ship that was discovered at Gokstad in 1880. On the oak planks
forming the deck of the vessel were found boles and lines marking out
the game, the holes being made to receive pegs. While inspecting the
ancient oak furniture in the Rijks Museum at Amsterdam I became
interested in an old catechumen's settle, and was surprised to find
the game diagram cut in the centre of the seat&mdash;quite conveniently for
surreptitious play. It has been discovered cut in the choir stalls of
several of our English cathedrals. In the early eighties it was found
scratched upon a stone built into a wall (probably about the date
1200), during the restoration of Hargrave church in Northamptonshire.
This stone is now in the Northampton Museum. A similar stone has since
been found at Sempringham, Lincolnshire. It is to be seen on an
ancient tombstone in the Isle of Man, and painted on old Dutch tiles.
And in 1901 a stone was dug out of a gravel pit near Oswestry bearing
an undoubted diagram of the game.</p>

<p>The game has been played with different <span class='pagenum'>Pg 59<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>rules at different periods
and places. I give a copy of the board. Sometimes the diagonal lines
are omitted, but this evidently was not intended to affect the play:
it simply meant that the angles alone were thought sufficient to
indicate the points. This is how Strutt, in <i>Sports and Pastimes</i>,
describes the game, and it agrees with the way I played it as a
boy:&mdash;"Two persons, having each of them nine pieces, or men, lay them
down alternately, one by one, upon the spots; and the business of
either party is to prevent his antagonist from placing three of his
pieces so as to form a row of three, without the intervention of an
opponent piece. If a row be formed, he that made it is at liberty to
take up one of his competitor's pieces from any part he thinks most to
his advantage; excepting he has made a row, which must not be touched
if he have another piece upon the board that is not a component part
of that row. When all the pieces are laid down, they are played
backwards and forwards, in any direction that the lines run, but only
can move from one spot to another (next to it) at one time. He that
takes off all his antagonist's pieces is the conqueror."</p>

<p>The six educated frogs in the illustration are trained to reverse
their order, so that their numbers shall read 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, with
the blank square in its present position. They can jump to the next
square (if vacant) or leap over one frog to the next square beyond (if
vacant), just as we move in the game of draughts, and can go backwards
or forwards at pleasure. Can you show how they perform their feat in
the fewest possible moves? It is quite easy, so when you have done it
add a seventh frog to the right and try again. Then add more frogs
until you are able to give the shortest solution for any number. For
it can always be done, with that single vacant square, no matter how
many frogs there are.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that this puzzle was a great favourite among the
young apprentices of the City of London in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. Readers will have noticed the curious brass
grasshopper on the Royal Exchange. This long-lived creature escaped
the fires of 1666 and 1838. The grasshopper, after his kind, was the
crest of Sir Thomas Gresham, merchant grocer, who died in 1579, and
from this cause it has been used as a sign by grocers in general.
Unfortunately for the legend as to its origin, the puzzle was only
produced by myself so late as the year 1900. On twelve of the thirteen
black discs are placed numbered counters or grasshoppers. The puzzle
is to reverse their order, so that they shall read, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.,
in the opposite direction, with the vacant disc left in the same
position as at present. Move one at a time in any order, either to the
adjoining vacant disc or by jumping over one grasshopper, like the
moves in draughts. The moves or leaps may be made in either direction
that is at any time possible. What are the fewest possible moves in
which it can be done?</p>

<p>Our six educated frogs have learnt a new and pretty feat. When placed
on glass tumblers, as shown in the illustration, they change sides so
that the three black ones are to the left and the white frogs to the
right, with the unoccupied tumbler at the opposite end&mdash;No. 7. They
can jump to the next tumbler (if unoccupied), or over one, or two,
frogs to an unoccupied tumbler. The jumps can be made in either
direction, and a frog may jump over his own or the opposite colour, or
both colours. Four sue<span class='pagenum'>Pg 60<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>cessive specimen jumps will make everything
quite plain: 4 to 1, 5 to 4, 3 to 5, 6 to 3. Can you show how they do
it in ten jumps?</p>

<p>In the illustration we have eleven discs in a circle. On five of the
discs we place white counters with black letters&mdash;as shown&mdash;and on
five other discs the black counters with white letters. The bottom
disc is left vacant. Starting thus, it is required to get the counters
into order so that they spell the word "Twickenham" in a clockwise
direction, leaving the vacant disc in the original position. The black
counters move in the direction that a clock-hand revolves, and the
white counters go the opposite way. A counter may jump over one of the
opposite colour if the vacant disc is next beyond. Thus, if your first
move is with K, then C can jump over K. If then K moves towards E, you
may next jump W over C, and so on. The puzzle may be solved in
twenty-six moves. Remember a counter cannot jump over one of its own
colour.</p>

<p>The puzzle-maker is peculiarly a "snapper-up of unconsidered trifles,"
and his productions are often built up with the slenderest materials.
Trivialities that might entirely escape the observation of others, or,
if they were observed, would be regarded as of no possible moment,
often supply the man who is in quest of posers with a pretty theme or
an idea that he thinks possesses some "basal value."</p>

<p>When seated opposite to a lady in a railway carriage at the time of
Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, my attention was attracted to a
brooch that she was wearing. It was in the form of a Maltese or
Victoria Cross, and bore the letters of the word VICTORIA. The number
and arrangement of the letters immediately gave me the suggestion for
the puzzle which I now present.</p>

<p>The diagram, it will be seen, is composed of nine divisions. The
puzzle is to place eight counters, bearing the letters of the word
VICTORIA, exactly in the manner shown, and then slide one letter at a
time from black to white and white to black alternately, until the
word reads round in the same direction, only with the initial letter V
on one of the black arms of the cross. At no time may two letters be
in the same division. It is required to find the shortest method.</p>

<p>Leaping moves are, of course, not permitted. The first move must
obviously be made with A, I, T, or R. Supposing you move T to the
centre, the next counter played will be O or C, since I or R cannot be
moved. There is something a little remarkable in the solution of this
puzzle which I will explain.</p>

<p>Here is a little reminiscence of our old friend the Fifteen Block
Puzzle. Eight wooden blocks are lettered, and are placed in a box, as
shown in the illustration. It will be seen that you can only move one
block at a time to the place vacant for the time being, as no block
may be lifted out of the box. The puzzle is to shift them about until
you get them in the order&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">G&nbsp;  H</span><br />
</p>

<p>This you will find by no means difficult if you are allowed as many
moves as you like. But the puzzle is to do it in the fewest possible
moves. I will not say what this smallest number of moves is, because
the reader may like to discover it for himself. In writing down your
moves you will find it necessary to record no more than the letters in
the order that they are shifted. Thus, your first five moves might be
C, H, G, E, F; and this notation can have no possible ambiguity. In
practice you only need eight counters and a simple diagram on a sheet
of paper.</p>

<p>The Dobsons secured apartments at Slocomb-on-Sea. There were six rooms
on the same floor, all communicating, as shown in the diagram. The
rooms they took were numbers 4, 5, and 6, all facing the sea. But a
little difficulty arose. Mr. Dobson insisted that the piano and the
bookcase should change rooms. This was wily, for the Dobsons were not
musical, but they wanted to prevent any one else playing the
instrument. Now, the rooms were very small and the pieces of furniture
indicated were very big, so that no two of these articles could be got
into any room at the same time. How was the exchange to be made with
the least possible labour? Suppose, for example, you first move the
wardrobe into No. 2; then you can move the bookcase to No. 5 and the
piano to No. 6, and so on. It is a fascinating puzzle, but the
landlady had reasons for not appreciating it. Try to solve her
difficulty in the fewest possible removals with counters on a sheet of
paper.</p>

<p>The plan represents a portion of the line of the London, Clodville,

only room for eight wagons, or seven wagons and an engine, between B
and C on either the left line or the right line of the loop. It
happened that two goods trains (each consisting of an engine and
sixteen wagons) got into the position shown in the illustration. It
looked like a hopeless deadlock, and each engine-driver wanted the
other to go back to the next station and take off nine wagons. But an
ingenious stoker undertook to pass the trains and send them on their
respective journeys with their engines properly in front. He also
contrived to reverse the engines the fewest times possible. Could you
have performed the feat? And how many times would you require to
reverse the engines? A "reversal" means a change of direction,
backward or forward. No rope-shunting, fly-shunting, or other trick is
allowed. All the work must be done legitimately by the two engines. It
is a simple but interesting puzzle if attempted with counters.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the proprietor of a motor garage are converted
into a little pastime of a kind that has a peculiar fascination. All
you need is to make a simple plan or diagram on a sheet of paper or
cardboard and number eight counters, 1 to 8. Then a whole family can
enter into an amusing competition to find the best possible solution
of the difficulty.</p>

<p>The illustration represents the plan of a motor garage, with
accommodation for twelve cars. But the premises are so inconveniently
restricted that the proprietor is often caused considerable
perplexity. Suppose, for example, that the eight cars numbered 1 to 8
are in the positions shown, how are they to be shifted in the quickest
possible way so that 1, 2, 3, and 4 shall change places with 5, 6, 7,
and 8&mdash;that is, with the numbers still running from left to right, as
at present, but the top row exchanged with the bottom row? What are
the fewest possible moves?</p>

<p>One car moves at a time, and any distance counts as one move. To
prevent misunderstanding, the stopping-places are marked in squares,
and only one car can be in a square at the same time.</p>

<p>If prisons had no other use, they might still be preserved for the

mine of perplexing ideas. Here is a little poser that will perhaps
interest the reader for a short period. We have in the illustration a
prison of sixteen cells. The locations of the ten prisoners will be
seen. The jailer has queer superstitions about odd and even numbers,
and he <span class='pagenum'>Pg 63<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>wants to rearrange the ten prisoners so that there shall be as
many even rows of men, vertically, horizontally, and diagonally, as
possible. At present it will be seen, as indicated by the arrows, that
there are only twelve such rows of 2 and 4. I will state at once that
the greatest number of such rows that is possible is sixteen. But the
jailer only allows four men to be removed to other cells, and informs
me that, as the man who is seated in the bottom right-hand corner is
infirm, he must not be moved. Now, how are we to get those sixteen
rows of even numbers under such conditions?</p>

<p>Here is a puzzle that will, I think, be found as amusing as
instructive. We are given a ring of eight circles. Leaving circle 8
blank, we are required to write in the name of a seven-lettered port
in the United Kingdom in this manner. Touch a blank circle with your
pencil, then jump over two circles in either direction round the ring,
and write down the first letter. Then touch another vacant circle,
jump over two circles, and write down your second letter. Proceed
similarly with the other letters in their proper order until you have
completed the word. Thus, suppose we select "Glasgow," and proceed as
follows: 6&mdash;1, 7&mdash;2, 8&mdash;3, 7&mdash;4, 8&mdash;5, which means that we touch 6,
jump over 7 and and write down "G" on 1; then touch 7, jump over 8 and
1, and write down "l" on 2; and so on. It will be found that after we
have written down the first five letters&mdash;"Glasg"&mdash;as above, we cannot
go any further. Either there is something wrong with "Glasgow," or we
have not managed our jumps properly. Can you get to the bottom of the
mystery?</p>

<p>This ancient puzzle was a great favourite with our grandmothers, and
most of us, I imagine, have on occasions come across a "Solitaire"
board&mdash;a round polished board with holes cut in it in a geometrical
pattern, and a glass marble in every hole. Sometimes I have noticed
one on a side table in a suburban front parlour, or found one on a
shelf in a country cottage, or had one brought under my notice at a
wayside inn. Sometimes they are of the form shown above, but it is
equally common for the board to have four more holes, at the points
indicated by dots. I select the simpler form.</p>

<p>Though "Solitaire" boards are still sold at the toy shops, it will be
sufficient if the reader will make an enlarged copy of the above on a
sheet of cardboard or paper, number the "holes," and provide himself
with 33 counters, buttons, or beans. Now place a counter in every hole
except the central one, No. 17, and the puzzle is to take off all the
counters in a series of jumps, except the last counter, which must be
left in that central hole. You are <span class='pagenum'>Pg 64<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>allowed to jump one counter over
the next one to a vacant hole beyond, just as in the game of draughts,
and the counter jumped over is immediately taken off the board. Only
remember every move must be a jump; consequently you will take off a
counter at each move, and thirty-one single jumps will of course
remove all the thirty-one counters. But compound moves are allowed (as
in draughts, again), for so long as one counter continues to jump, the
jumps all count as one move.</p>

<p>Here is the beginning of an imaginary solution which will serve to
make the manner of moving perfectly plain, and show how the solver
should write out his attempts: 5-17, 12-10, 26-12, 24-26 (13-11,
11-25), 9-11 (26-24, 24-10, 10-12), etc., etc. The jumps contained
within brackets count as one move, because they are made with the same
counter. Find the fewest possible moves. Of course, no diagonal jumps
are permitted; you can only jump in the direction of the lines.</p>

<p>The family represented in the illustration are amusing themselves with
this little puzzle, which is not very difficult but quite interesting.
They have, it will be seen, placed sixteen plates on the table in the
form of a square, and put an apple in each of ten plates. They want to
find a way of removing all the apples except one by jumping over one
at a time to the next vacant square, as in draughts; or, better, as in
solitaire, for you are not allowed to make any diagonal moves&mdash;only
moves parallel to the sides of the square. It is obvious that as the
apples stand no move can be made, but you are permitted to transfer
any single apple you like to a vacant plate before starting. Then the
moves must be all leaps, taking off the apples leaped over.</p>

<p>"Here is a little puzzle," said a Parson, "that I have found
peculiarly fascinating. It is so simple, and yet it keeps you
interested indefinitely."</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman took a sheet of paper and divided it off into
twenty-five squares, like a square portion of a chessboard. Then he
placed nine almonds on the central squares, as shown in the
illustration, where we have represented numbered counters for
convenience in giving the solution.</p>

<p>"Now, the puzzle is," continued the Parson, "to remove eight of the
almonds and leave the ninth in the central square. You make the
removals by jumping one almond over another to the vacant square
beyond and taking off the one jumped over&mdash;just as in draughts, only
here you can jump in any direction, and not diagonally only. The point
is to do the thing in the fewest possible moves."</p>

<p>The following specimen attempt will make everything clear. Jump 4 over
1, 5 over 9, 3 over 6, 5 over 3, 7 over 5 and 2, 4 over 7, 8 over 4.
But 8 is not left in the central square, as it <span class='pagenum'>Pg 65<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>should be. Remember to
remove those you jump over. Any number of jumps in succession with the
same almond count as one move.</p>

<p>Here is a pretty little puzzle that only requires twelve pennies or

take up one penny at a time and, passing it over two pennies, place it
on the third penny. Then take up another single penny and do the same
thing, and so on, until, in six such moves, you have the coins in six
pairs in the positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. You can move in either
direction round the circle at every play, and it does not matter
whether the two jumped over are separate or a pair. This is quite easy
if you use just a little thought.</p>

<p>Place twelve plates, as shown, on a round table, with a penny or
orange in every plate. Start from any plate you like and, always going

other pennies, and place it in the next plate. Go on again; take up
another penny and, having passed it over two pennies, place it in a
plate; and so continue your journey. Six coins only are to be removed,
and when these have been placed there should be two coins in each of
six plates and six plates empty. An important point of the puzzle is
to go round the table as few times as possible. It does not matter
whether the two coins passed over are in one or two plates, nor how
many empty plates you pass a coin over. But you must always go in one
direction round the table and end at the point from which you set out.
Your hand, that is to say, goes steadily forward in one direction,
without ever moving backwards.</p>

<p>The cheesemonger depicted in the illustration is an inveterate puzzle
lover. One of his favourite puzzles is the piling of cheeses in his
warehouse, an amusement that he finds good exercise for the body as
well as for the mind. He places sixteen cheeses on the floor in a
straight row and then makes them into four piles, with four cheeses in
every pile, by always passing a cheese over four others. If you use
sixteen counters and number them in order from 1 to 16, then you may
place 1 on 6, 11 on 1, 7 on 4, and so on, until there are four in
every pile. It will be seen that it does not matter whether the four
passed over are standing alone or piled; they count just the same, and
you can always carry a cheese in either direction. There are a great
many different ways of doing it in twelve moves, so it makes a good
game of "patience" to try to solve it so that the four piles shall be
left in different stipulated places. For example, try to leave the
piles at the extreme ends of the row, on Nos. 1, 2, 15 and 16; this is

the diagram we have arranged the fleet in square formation, where it
will be seen that as many as seven ships may be sunk (those in the top
row and first column) by firing the torpedoes indicated by arrows.
Anchoring the fleet as we like, to what extent can we increase this
number? Remember that each successive ship is sunk before another
torpedo is launched, and that every torpedo proceeds in a different
direction; otherwise, by placing the ships in a straight line, we

<p>I happened to see a little girl sorting out some jam in a cupboard for
her mother. She was putting each different kind of preserve apart on
the shelves. I noticed that she took a pot of damson in one hand and a
pot of gooseberry in the other and made them change places; then she
changed a strawberry with a raspberry, and so on. It was interesting
to observe what a lot of unnecessary trouble she gave herself by
making more interchanges than there was any need for, and I thought it
would work into a good puzzle.</p>

<p>It will be seen in the illustration that little Dorothy has to
manipulate twenty-four large jampots in as many pigeon-holes. She
wants to get them in correct numerical order&mdash;that is, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6 on the top shelf, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 on the next shelf, and so on.
Now, if she always takes one pot in the right hand and another in the
left and makes them change places, how many of these interchanges will
be necessary to get all the jampots in proper order? She would
naturally first change the 1 and the 3, then the 2 and the 3, when she
would have the first three pots in their places. How would you advise
her to go on then? Place some numbered counters on a sheet of paper
divided into squares for the pigeon-holes, and you will find it an
amusing puzzle.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to suppose that from the earliest ages one man has
asked another such questions as these: "Which is the nearest way
home?" "Which is the easiest or pleasantest way?" "How can we find a
way that will enable us to dodge the mastodon and the plesiosaurus?"
"How can we get there without ever crossing the track of the enemy?"
All these are elementary route problems, and they can be turned into
good puzzles by the introduction of some conditions that complicate
matters. A variety of such complications will be found in the
following examples. I have also included some enumerations of more or
less difficulty. These afford excellent practice for the reasoning
faculties, and enable one to generalize in the case of symmetrical
forms in a manner that is most instructive.</p>

<p>For years I have been perpetually consulted by my juvenile friends
about this little puzzle. Most children seem to know it, and yet,
curiously enough, they are invariably unacquainted with the answer.
The question they always ask is, "Do, please, tell me whether it is
really possible." I believe Houdin the conjurer used to be very fond
of giving it to his child friends, but I cannot say whether he
invented the little puzzle or not. No doubt a large number of my
readers will be glad to have the mystery of the solution cleared up,
so I make no apology for introducing this old "teaser."</p>

<p>The puzzle is to draw with three strokes of the pencil the diagram
that the little girl is exhibiting in the illustration. Of course, you
must not remove your pencil from the paper during a stroke or go over
the same line a second time. You will find that you can get <span class='pagenum'>Pg 69<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>in a good
deal of the figure with one continuous stroke, but it will always
appear as if four strokes are necessary.</p>

<p>The man in our illustration is in a little dilemma. He has just been
appointed inspector of a certain system of tube railways, and it is
his duty to inspect regularly, within a stated period, all the
company's seventeen lines connecting twelve stations, as shown on the
big poster plan that he is contemplating. Now he wants to arrange his
route so that it shall take him over all the lines with as little
travelling as possible. He may begin where he likes and end where he
likes. What is his shortest route?</p>

<p>Could anything be simpler? But the reader will soon find that, however
he decides to proceed, the inspector must go over some of the lines
more than once. In other words, if we say that the stations are a mile
apart, he will have to travel more than seventeen miles to inspect
every line. There is the little difficulty. How far is he compelled to
travel, and which route do you recommend?</p>

started, and must take no notice of cross roads, but go straight from
town to town. This is an absurdly easy puzzle, if you go the right way

<p>Here is another queer travelling puzzle, the solution of which calls
for ingenuity. In this case the traveller starts from the black town
and wishes to go as far as possible while making only fifteen turnings
and never going along the same road twice. The towns are supposed to
be a mile apart. Supposing, for example, that he went straight to A,
then straight to B, then to C, D, E, and F, you will then find that he
has travelled thirty-seven miles in five turnings. Now, how far can he
go in fifteen turnings?</p>

<p>"Look here," said the professor to his colleague, "I have been
watching that fly on the octahedron, and it confines its walks
entirely to the edges. What can be its reason for avoiding the sides?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is trying to solve some route problem," suggested the

their failure, let him attempt the little puzzle himself. I will just
explain that the octahedron is one of the five regular, or Platonic,
bodies, and is contained under eight equal and equilateral triangles.
If you cut out the two pieces of cardboard of the shape shown in the
margin of the illustration, cut half through along the dotted lines
and then bend them and put them together, you will have a perfect
octahedron. In any route over all the edges it will be found that the
fly must end at the point of departure at the top.</p>

<p>The icosahedron is another of the five regular, or Platonic, bodies
having all their sides, angles, and planes similar and equal. It is
bounded by twenty similar equilateral triangles. If you cut out a
piece of cardboard of the form shown in the smaller diagram, and cut
half through along the dotted lines, it will fold up and form a
perfect icosahedron.</p>

<p>Now, a Platonic body does not mean a <span class='pagenum'>Pg 71<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>heavenly body; but it will suit
the purpose of our puzzle if we suppose there to be a habitable planet
of this shape. We will also suppose that, owing to a superfluity of
water, the only dry land is along the edges, and that the inhabitants
have no knowledge of navigation. If every one of those edges is 10,000
miles long and a solitary traveller is placed at the North Pole (the
highest point shown), how far will he have to travel before he will
have visited every habitable part of the planet&mdash;that is, have
traversed every one of the edges?</p>

<p>The diagram is supposed to represent the passages or galleries in a
mine. We will assume that every passage, A to B, B to C, C to H, H to
I, and so on, is one furlong in length. It will be seen that there are
thirty-one of these passages. Now, an official has to inspect all of
them, and he descends by the shaft to the point A. How far must he
travel, and what route do you recommend? The reader may at first say,
"As there are thirty-one passages, each a furlong in length, he will
have to travel just thirty-one furlongs." But this is assuming that he
need never go along a passage more than once, which is not the case.
Take your pencil and try to find the shortest route. You will soon
discover that there is room for considerable judgment. In fact, it is
a perplexing puzzle.</p>

<p>The sailor depicted in the illustration stated that he had since his
boyhood been engaged in trading with a small vessel among some twenty
little islands in the Pacific. He supplied the rough chart of which I
have given a copy, and explained that the lines from island to island
represented the only routes that he ever adopted. He always started
from island A at the beginning of the season, and then visited every
island <span class='pagenum'>Pg 72<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>once, and once only, finishing up his tour at the
starting-point A. But he always put off his visit to C as long as
possible, for trade reasons that I need not enter into. The puzzle is
to discover his exact route, and this can be done with certainty. Take
your pencil and, starting at A, try to trace it out. If you write down
the islands in the order in which you visit them&mdash;thus, for example,
A, I, O, L, G, etc.&mdash;you can at once see if you have visited an island
twice or omitted any. Of course, the crossings of the lines must be
ignored&mdash;that is, you must continue your route direct, and you are not
allowed to switch off at a crossing and proceed in another direction.
There is no trick of this kind in the puzzle. The sailor knew the best
route. Can you find it?</p>

<p>One of the everyday puzzles of life is the working out of routes. If
you are taking a holiday on your bicycle, or a motor tour, there
always arises the question of how you are to make the best of your
time and other resources. You have determined to get as far as some
particular place, to include visits to such-and-such a town, to try to
see something of special interest elsewhere, and perhaps to try to
look up an old friend at a spot that will not take you much out of
your way. Then you have to plan your route so as to avoid bad roads,
uninteresting country, and, if possible, the necessity of a return by
the same way that you went. With a map before you, the interesting
puzzle is attacked and solved. I will present a little poser based on
these lines.</p>

<p>I give a rough map of a country&mdash;it is not necessary to say what
particular country&mdash;the circles representing towns and the dotted
lines the railways connecting them. Now there lived in the town marked
A a man who was born there, and during the whole of his life had never
once left his native place. From his youth upwards he had been very
industrious, sticking incessantly to his trade, and had no desire
whatever to roam abroad. However, on attaining his fiftieth birthday
he decided to see something of his country, and especially to pay a
visit to a very old friend living at the town marked Z. <span class='pagenum'>Pg 73<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>What he
proposed was this: that he would start from his home, enter every town
once and only once, and finish his journey at Z. As he made up his
mind to perform this grand tour by rail only, he found it rather a
puzzle to work out his route, but he at length succeeded in doing so.
How did he manage it? Do not forget that every town has to be visited
once, and not more than once.</p>

how many different ways it was possible to spell out her name, always
passing from one letter to another that was adjacent. Diagonal steps
are here allowed. Whether she did this merely to tease him or to test
his cleverness is not recorded, but it is satisfactory to know that he
succeeded. Would you have been equally successful? Take your pencil
and try. You may start from any of the H's and go backwards or
forwards and in any direction, so long as all the letters in a
spelling are adjoining one another. How many ways are there, no two
exactly alike?</p>

monastery. This is, of course, quite easy to do, but on the way he
thought to himself, "I wonder how many different routes there are from
which I might have selected." Could you have told him? That is the
puzzle. Take your pencil and trace out a route that will take you once

third, and see if you can count all the variations. You will find that
the difficulty is twofold: you have to avoid dropping routes on the
one hand and counting the same routes more than once on the other.</p>

"A combination and a form indeed."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>Hamlet</i>, iii. 4.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Various puzzles in this class might be termed problems in the
"geometry of situation," but their solution really depends on the
theory of combinations which, in its turn, is derived directly from
the theory of permutations. It has seemed convenient to include here
certain group puzzles and enumerations that might, perhaps, with equal
reason have been placed elsewhere; but readers are again asked not to
be too critical about the classification, which is very difficult and
arbitrary. As I have included my problem of "The Round Table" (No.
273), perhaps a few remarks on another well-known problem of the same
class, known by the French as La Probl&ecirc;me des M&eacute;nages, may be
interesting. If <i>n</i> married ladies are seated at a round table in any
determined order, in how many different ways may their <i>n</i> husbands be
placed so that every man is between two ladies but never next to his
own wife?</p>

<p>This difficult problem was first solved by Laisant, and the method
shown in the following table is due to Moreau:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" summary="">
<tr><td align='right'>4</td><td align='right'>0</td><td align='right'>2</td></tr>

<tr><td align='right'>9</td><td align='right'>4821</td><td align='right'>43387</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>10</td><td align='right'>43979</td><td align='right'>439792</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The first column shows the number of married couples. The numbers in
the second column are obtained in this way: 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;0&nbsp;-&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;13; 6&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;13 +
3&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;83; 7&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;83&nbsp;+&nbsp;13&nbsp;-&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;592; 8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;592&nbsp;+&nbsp;83&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;4821; and so on.
Find all the numbers, except 2, in the table, and the method will be
evident. It will be noted that the 2 is subtracted when the first
number (the number of couples) is odd, and added when that number is
even. The numbers in the third column are obtained thus: 13&nbsp;-&nbsp;0&nbsp;=&nbsp;13; 83
- 3&nbsp;=&nbsp;80; 592&nbsp;-&nbsp;13&nbsp;=&nbsp;579; 4821&nbsp;-&nbsp;83&nbsp;=&nbsp;4738; and so on. The numbers in
this last column give the required solutions. Thus, four husbands may
be seated in two ways, five husbands may be placed in thirteen ways,
and six husbands in eighty ways.</p>

<p>The following method, by Lucas, will show the remarkable way in which
chessboard analysis may be applied to the solution of a circular
problem of this kind. Divide a square into thirty-six cells, six by
six, and strike out all the cells in the long diagonal from the bottom
left-hand corner to the top right-hand corner, also the five cells in
the diagonal next above it and the cell in the bottom right-hand
corner. The answer for six couples will be the same as the number of
ways in which you can place six rooks (not using the cancelled cells)
so that no rook shall ever attack another rook. It will be found that
the six rooks may be placed in eighty different ways, which agrees
with the above table.</p>

<p>A certain cyclop&aelig;dia has the following curious problem, I am told:
"Place fifteen sheep in four pens so that there shall be the same
number of sheep in each pen." No answer whatever is vouchsafed, so I
thought I would investigate the matter. I saw that in dealing with
apples or bricks the thing would appear to be quite impossible, since
four times any number must be an even number, while fifteen is an odd
number. I thought, therefore, that there must be some quality peculiar
to the sheep that was not generally known. So I decided to interview
some farmers on the subject. The first one pointed out that if we put
one pen inside another, like the rings of a target, and placed all
sheep in the smallest pen, it would be all right. But I objected to
this, because you admittedly place all the sheep in one pen, not in
four pens. The second man said that if I placed four sheep in each of
three pens and three sheep in the last pen (that is fifteen sheep in
all), and one of the ewes in the last pen had a lamb during the night,
there would be the same number in each pen in the morning. This also
failed to satisfy me.</p>

<p>The third farmer said, "I've got four hurdle pens down in one of my
fields, and a small flock of wethers, so if you will just step down
with me I will show you how it is done." The illustration depicts my
friend as he is about to demonstrate the matter to me. His lucid
explanation was evidently that which was in the mind of the writer of
the article in the cyclop&aelig;dia. What was it? Can you place those
fifteen sheep?</p>

that every man took a hat that did not belong to him?"</p>

<p>A certain generous London manufacturer gives his workmen every year a
week's holiday at the seaside at his own expense. One year fifteen of
his men paid a visit to Herne Bay. On the morning of their departure
from London they were addressed by their employer, who expressed the
hope that they would have a very pleasant time.</p>

<p>"I have been given to understand," he added, "that some of you fellows
are very fond of rowing, so I propose on this occasion to provide you
with this recreation, and at the same time give you an amusing little
puzzle to solve. During the seven days that you are at Herne Bay every
one of you will go out every day at the same time for a row, but there
must always be three men in a boat and no more. No two men may ever go
out in a boat together more than once, and no man is allowed to go out
twice in the same boat. If you can manage to do this, and use as few
different boats as possible, you may charge the firm with the
expense."</p>

<p>One of the men tells me that the experience he has gained in such
matters soon enabled him to work out the answer to the entire
satisfaction of themselves and their employer. But the amusing part of
the thing is that they never really solved the little mystery. I find
their method to have been quite incorrect, and I think it will amuse
my readers to discover how the men should have been placed in the
boats. As their names happen to have been Andrews, Baker, Carter,
Danby, Edwards, Frith, Gay, Hart, Isaacs, Jackson, Kent, Lang, Mason,
Napper, and Onslow, we can call them by their initials and write out
the five groups for each of the seven days in the following simple
way:</p>

<div class='center'>

<p>The men within each pair of brackets are here seen to be in the same
boat, and therefore A can never go out with B or with C again, and C
can never go out again with B. The same applies to the other four
boats. The figures show the number on the boat, so that A, B, or C,
for example, can never go out in boat No. 1 again.</p>

their skill to a sufficient test, somebody asked the following
question: "What is the total number of different ways in which these
sixteen balls may be broken, if we must always break the lowest ball
that remains on any string?" Thus, one way would be to break all the
four balls on each string in succession, taking the strings from left
to right. Another would be to break all the fourth balls on the four
strings first, then break the three remaining on the first string,
then take the balls on the three other strings alternately from right
to left, and so on. There is such a vast number of different ways
(since every little variation of order makes a different way) that one
is apt to be at first impressed by the great difficulty of the
problem. Yet it is really quite simple when once you have hit on the
proper method of attacking it. How many different ways are there?</p>

<p>The above is the solution of a puzzle I gave in <i>Tit-bits</i> in the
summer of 1896. It was required to take the letters, A, B, C, D, E, F,
G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, and O, and with them form thirty-five groups
of three letters so that the combinations should include the greatest
number possible of common English words. No two letters may appear
together in a group more than once. Thus, A and L having been together
in ALE, must never be found together again; nor may A appear again in
a group with E, nor L with E. These conditions will be found complied
with in the above solution, and the number of words formed is
twenty-one. Many persons have since tried hard to beat this number,
but so far have not succeeded.</p>

<p>More than thirty-five combinations of the fifteen letters cannot be
formed within the conditions. Theoretically, there cannot possibly be
more than twenty-three words formed, because only this number of
combinations is possible with a vowel or vowels in each. And as no
English word can be formed from three of the given vowels (A, E, I,
and O), we must reduce the number of possible words to twenty-two.
This is correct theoretically, but practically that twenty-second word
cannot be got in. If JEK, shown above, were a word it would be all
right; but it is not, and no amount of juggling with the other letters
has resulted in a better answer than the one shown. I should, say that
proper nouns and abbreviations, such as Joe, Jim, Alf, Hal, Flo, Ike,
etc., are disallowed.</p>

<p>Now, the present puzzle is a variation of the above. It is simply
this: Instead of using the fifteen letters given, the reader is
allowed to select any fifteen different letters of the alphabet that
he may prefer. Then construct thirty-five <span class='pagenum'>Pg 80<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>groups in accordance with
the conditions, and show as many good English words as possible.</p>

<p>This is a new and interesting companion puzzle to the "Fifteen
Schoolgirls" (see solution of No. 269), and even in the simplest
possible form in which I present it there are unquestionable
difficulties. Nine schoolboys walk out in triplets on the six week
days so that no boy ever walks <i>side by side</i> with any other boy more
than once. How would you arrange them?</p>

<p>If we represent them by the first nine letters of the alphabet, they
might be grouped on the first day as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Then A can never walk again side by side with B, or B with C, or D
with E, and so on. But A can, of course, walk side by side with C. It
is here not a question of being together in the same triplet, but of
walking side by side in a triplet. Under these conditions they can
walk out on six days; under the "Schoolgirls" conditions they can only
walk on four days.</p>

them in a circle in the particular order shown in the illustration.
These cards represent mice. You start from any card, calling that card

and when your count agrees with the number on the card, you have made
a "catch," and you remove the card. Then start at the next card,
calling that "one," and try again to make another "catch." And so on.
Supposing you start at 18, calling that card "one," your first "catch"
will be 19. Remove 19 and your next "catch" is 10. Remove 10 and your
next "catch" is 1. Remove the 1, and if you count up to 21 (you must
never go beyond), you cannot make another "catch." Now, the ideal is
to "catch" all the twenty-one mice, but this is not here possible, and
if it were it would merely require twenty-one different trials, at the
most, to succeed. But the reader may make any two cards change places
before he begins. Thus, you can change the 6 with the 2, or the 7 with
the 11, or any other pair. This can be done in several ways so as to
enable you to "catch" all the twenty-one mice, if you then start at
the right place. You may never pass over a "catch"; you must always
remove the card and start afresh.</p>

<p>Here is a new puzzle with matches and counters or coins. In the
illustration the matches represent hurdles and the counters sheep. The
sixteen hurdles on the outside, and the sheep, must be regarded as
immovable; the puzzle has to do entirely with the nine hurdles on the
inside. It will be seen that at present these nine hurdles enclose
four groups of 8, 3, 3, and 2 sheep. The farmer requires to readjust
some of the hurdles so as to enclose 6, 6, and 4 sheep. Can you do it
by only replacing two hurdles? When you have succeeded, then try to
do it by replacing three hurdles; then four, five, six, and seven in
succession. Of course, the hurdles must be legitimately laid on the
dotted lines, and no such tricks are allowed as leaving unconnected
ends of hurdles, or two hurdles placed side by side, or merely making
hurdles change places. In fact, the conditions are so simple that any
farm labourer will understand it directly.</p>

<p>In one of the outlying suburbs of London a man had a square plot of
ground on which he <span class='pagenum'>Pg 81<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>decided to build eight villas, as shown in the
illustration, with a common recreation ground in the middle. After the
houses were completed, and all or some of them let, he discovered that
the number of occupants in the three houses forming a side of the
square was in every case nine. He did not state how the occupants were
distributed, but I have shown by the numbers on the sides of the
houses one way in which it might have happened. The puzzle is to
discover the total number of ways in which all or any of the houses
might be occupied, so that there should be nine persons on each side.
In order that there may be no misunderstanding, I will explain that
although B is what we call a reflection of A, these would count as two
different arrangements, while C, if it is turned round, will give four
arrangements; and if turned round in front of a mirror, four other
arrangements. All eight must be counted.</p>

<p>All that we need for this puzzle is nine counters, numbered 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It will be seen that in the illustration A these
are arranged so as to form a Greek cross, while in the case of B they
form a Latin cross. In both cases the reader will find that the sum of
the numbers in the upright of the cross is the same as the sum of the
numbers in the horizontal arm. It is quite easy to hit on such an
arrangement by trial, but the problem is to discover in exactly how
many different ways it may be done in each case. Remember that
reversals and reflections do not count as different. That is to say,
if you turn this page round you get four arrangements of the Greek
cross, and if you turn it round again in front of a mirror you will
get four more. But these eight are all regarded as one and the same.
Now, how many different ways are there in each case?</p>

overcrowding, and ordered that it should be reduced. On Tuesday she
found that five times as many slept on the south side as on each of
the other sides. Again she complained. On Wednesday she found four
times as many on the south side, on Thursday three times as many, and
on Friday twice as many. Urging the nuns to further efforts, she was
pleased to find on Saturday that an equal number slept on each of the
four <span class='pagenum'>Pg 82<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>sides of the house. What is the smallest number of nuns there

<p>A merchant of Bagdad had ten barrels of precious balsam for sale.
They were numbered, and were arranged in two rows, one on top of the
other, as shown in the picture. The smaller the number on the barrel,
the greater was its value. So that the best quality was numbered "1" and
the worst numbered "10," and all the other numbers of graduating values.
Now, the rule of Ahmed Assan, the merchant, was that he never put a
barrel either beneath or to the right of one of less value. The
arrangement shown is, of course, the simplest way of complying with this
condition. But there are many other ways&mdash;such, for example, as
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>This puzzle concerns the painting of the four sides of a tetrahedron,
or triangular pyramid. If you cut out a piece of cardboard of the
triangular shape shown in Fig. 1, and then cut half through along the
dotted lines, it will fold up and form a perfect triangular pyramid.
And I would first remind my readers that the primary colours of the
solar spectrum are seven&mdash;violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange,
and red. When I was a child I was taught to remember these by the
ungainly word formed by the initials of the colours, "Vibgyor."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/q281.png" width="600" height="246" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>In how many different ways may the triangular pyramid be coloured,
using in every case one, two, three, or four colours of the solar
spectrum? Of course a side can only receive a single colour, and no
side can be left uncoloured. But there is one point that I must make
quite clear. The four sides are not to be regarded as individually
distinct. That is to say, if you paint your pyramid as shown in Fig. 2
(where the bottom side is green and the other side that is out of view
is yellow), and then paint another in the order shown in Fig. 3, these
are really both the same and count as one way. For if you tilt over
No. 2 to the right it will so fall as to represent No. 3. The
avoidance of repetitions of this kind is the real puzzle of the thing.
If a coloured pyramid cannot be placed so that it exactly resembles in
its colours and their relative order another pyramid, then they are
different. Remember that one way would be to colour all the four sides
red, another to colour two sides green, and the remaining sides yellow
and blue; and so on.</p>

chain and the form of each link. Now, supposing the owner should
separate the links again, and then take them to another smith and
repeat his former instructions exactly, what are the chances against
the links being put together exactly as they were by the first man?
Remember that every successive link can be joined on to another in one
of two ways, just as you can put a ring on your finger in two ways, or
link your forefingers and thumbs in two ways.</p>

two attempts have been successful. The first man hit the four circles
at the top of the cross, and thus formed his square. The second man
intended to hit the four in the bottom arm, but his second shot, on
the left, went too high. This compelled him to complete his four in a
different way than he intended. It will thus be seen that though it is
immaterial which circle you hit at the first shot, the second shot may
commit you to a definite procedure if you are to get your square. Now,
the puzzle is to say in just how many different ways it is possible to
form a square on the target with four shots.</p>

</p>

<p>During a heavy gale a chimney-pot was hurled through the air, and
crashed upon the pavement just in front of a pedestrian. He quite
calmly said, "I have no use for it: I do not smoke." Some readers,
when they happen to see a puzzle represented on a chessboard with
chess pieces, are apt to make the equally inconsequent remark, "I have
no use for it: I do not play chess." This is largely a result of the
common, but erroneous, notion that the ordinary chess puzzle with
which we are familiar in the press (dignified, for some reason, with
the name "problem") has a vital connection with the game of chess
itself. But there is no condition in the game that you shall checkmate
your opponent in two moves, in three moves, or in four moves, while
the majority of the positions given in these puzzles are such that one
player would have so great a superiority in pieces that <span class='pagenum'>Pg 85<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>the other
would have resigned before the situations were reached. And the
solving of them helps you but little, and that quite indirectly, in
playing the game, it being well known that, as a rule, the best "chess
problemists" are indifferent players, and <i>vice versa</i>. Occasionally a
man will be found strong on both subjects, but he is the exception to
the rule.</p>

<p>Yet the simple chequered board and the characteristic moves of the
pieces lend themselves in a very remarkable manner to the devising of
the most entertaining puzzles. There is room for such infinite variety
that the true puzzle lover cannot afford to neglect them. It was with
a view to securing the interest of readers who are frightened off by
the mere presentation of a chessboard that so many puzzles of this
class were originally published by me in various fanciful dresses.
Some of these posers I still retain in their disguised form; others I
have translated into terms of the chessboard. In the majority of cases
the reader will not need any knowledge whatever of chess, but I have
thought it best to assume throughout that he is acquainted with the
terminology, the moves, and the notation of the game.</p>

<p>I first deal with a few questions affecting the chessboard itself;
then with certain statical puzzles relating to the Rook, the Bishop,
the Queen, and the Knight in turn; then dynamical puzzles with the
pieces in the same order; and, finally, with some miscellaneous
puzzles on the chessboard. It is hoped that the formul&aelig; and tables
given at the end of the statical puzzles will be of interest, as they
are, for the most part, published for the first time.</p>

<p>A chessboard is essentially a square plane divided into sixty-four
smaller squares by straight lines at right angles. Originally it was
not chequered (that is, made with its rows and columns alternately
black and white, or of any other two colours), and this improvement
was introduced merely to help the eye in actual play. The utility of
the chequers is unquestionable. For example, it facilitates the
operation of the bishops, enabling us to see at the merest glance that
our king or pawns on black squares are not open to attack from an
opponent's bishop running on the white diagonals. Yet the chequering
of the board is not essential to the game of chess. Also, when we are
propounding puzzles on the chessboard, it is often well to remember
that additional interest may result from "generalizing" for boards
containing any number of squares, or from limiting ourselves to some
particular chequered arrangement, not necessarily a square. We will
give a few puzzles dealing with chequered boards in this general way.</p>

<p>I recently asked myself the question: In how many different ways may a

cuts along the lines dividing the squares? The problem soon proved to
be both fascinating and bristling with difficulties. I present it in a

<p>It is obvious that a board of four squares can only be so divided in
one way&mdash;by a straight cut down the centre&mdash;because we shall not count
reversals and reflections as different. In the case of a board of
sixteen squares&mdash;four by four&mdash;there are just six different ways. I
have given all these in the diagram, and the reader will not find any
others. Now, take the larger board of thirty-six squares, and try to
discover in how many ways it may be cut into two parts of the same
size and shape.</p>

cut that square piece of valuable material into four parts, all of
exactly the same size and shape, but it is important that every piece
shall contain a lion and a crown. As she insists that the cuts can
only be made along the lines dividing the squares, she is considerably
perplexed to find out how it is to be done. Can you show her the way?
There is only one possible method of cutting the stuff.</p>

<p>We will here consider the question of those boards that contain an odd
number of squares. We will suppose that the central square is first
cut out, so as to leave an even number of squares for division. Now,
it is obvious that a square three by three can only be divided in one
way, as shown in Fig. 1. It will be seen that the pieces A and B are
of the same size and shape, and that any other way of cutting would
only produce the same shaped pieces, so remember that these variations
are not counted as different ways. The puzzle I propose is to cut the
board five by five (Fig. 2) into two pieces of the same size and shape
in as many different ways as possible. I have shown in the
illustration one way of doing it. How many different ways are there
altogether? A piece which when turned over resembles another piece is
not considered to be of a different shape.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Grand Lama who had a chessboard made of
pure gold, magnificently engraved, and, of course, of great value.
Every year a tournament was held at Lhassa among the priests, and
whenever any one beat the Grand Lama it was considered a great honour,
and his name was inscribed on the back of the board, and a costly
jewel set in the particular square on which the checkmate had been
given. After this sovereign pontiff had been defeated on four
occasions he died&mdash;possibly of chagrin.</p>

<p>Now the new Grand Lama was an inferior chess-player, and preferred
other forms of innocent amusement, such as cutting off people's heads.
So he discouraged chess as a degrading game, that did not improve
either the mind or the morals, and abolished the tournament summarily.
Then he sent for the four priests who had had the effrontery to play
better than a Grand Lama, and addressed them as follows: <span class='pagenum'>Pg 87<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>"Miserable

<p>Once upon a time the Lord Abbot of St. Edmondsbury, in consequence of
"devotions too strong for his head," fell sick and was unable to leave
his bed. As he lay awake, tossing his head restlessly from side to
side, the attentive monks noticed that something was disturbing his
mind; but nobody dared ask what it might be, for the abbot was of a
stern disposition, and never would brook inquisitiveness. Suddenly he
called for Father John, and that venerable monk was soon at the
bedside.</p>

<p>"Father John," said the Abbot, "dost thou know that I came into this
wicked world on a Christmas Even?"</p>

<p>The monk nodded assent.</p>

<p>"And have I not often told thee that, having been born on Christmas
Even, I have no love for the things that are odd? Look there!"</p>

<p>The Abbot pointed to the large dormitory window, of which I give a
sketch. The monk looked, and was perplexed.</p>

<p>"Dost thou not see that the sixty-four lights add up an even number
vertically and horizontally, but that all the <i>diagonal</i> lines, except
fourteen are of a number that is odd? Why is this?"</p>

<p>"Of a truth, my Lord Abbot, it is of the very nature of things, and
cannot be changed."</p>

<p>"Nay, but it <i>shall</i> be changed. I command thee that certain of the
lights be closed this day, so that every line shall have an even
number of lights. See thou that this be done without delay, lest the
cellars be locked up for a month and other grievous troubles befall
thee."</p>

<p>Father John was at his wits' end, but after consultation with one who
was learned in strange mysteries, a way was found to satisfy the whim
of the Lord Abbot. Which lights were blocked up, so that those which
remained added up an even number in every line horizontally,
vertically, and diagonally, while the least possible obstruction of
light was caused?</p>

<p>Into how large a number of different pieces may the chessboard be cut
(by cuts along the lines only), no two pieces being exactly alike?
Remember that the arrangement of black and white constitutes a
difference. Thus, a single black square will be different from a
single white square, a row of three containing two white squares will
differ from a row of three containing two black, and so on. If two
pieces cannot be placed on the table so as to be exactly alike, they
count as different. And as the back of the board is plain, the pieces
cannot be turned over.</p>

<p>I once set myself the amusing task of so dissecting an ordinary
chessboard into letters of the alphabet that they would form a
complete sentence. It will be seen from the illustration that the
pieces assembled give the sentence, "CUT THY LIFE," with the stops
between. The ideal sentence would, of course, have only one full stop,
but that I did not succeed in obtaining.</p>

<p>The sentence is an appeal to the transgressor to cut himself adrift
from the evil life he is living. Can you fit these pieces together to
form a perfect chessboard?</p>

<p>It will be seen in the first diagram that every square on the board is
either occupied or attacked by a rook, and that every rook is
"guarded" (if they were alternately black and white rooks we should
say "attacked") by another rook. Placing the eight rooks on any row or
file obviously will have the same effect. In diagram 2 every square is
again either occupied or attacked, but in this case every rook is
unguarded. Now, in how many different ways can you so place the eight
rooks on the board that every square shall be occupied or attacked and
no rook ever guarded by another? I do not wish to go into the question
of reversals and reflections on this occasion, so that placing the
rooks on the other diagonal will count as different, and similarly
with other repetitions obtained by turning the board round.</p>

<p>The puzzle is to find in how many different ways the four lions may be
placed so that there shall never be more than one lion in any row or

Thus, regarding the example given, if we place the lions in the other
diagonal, it will be considered the same arrangement. For if you hold
the second arrangement in front of a mirror or give it a quarter turn,
you merely get the first arrangement. It is a simple little puzzle,
but requires a certain amount of careful consideration.</p>

<p>Place as few bishops as possible on an ordinary chessboard so that
every square of the board shall be either occupied or attacked. It
will be seen that the rook has more scope than the bishop: for
wherever you place the former, it will always attack fourteen other
squares; whereas the latter will attack seven, nine, eleven, or
thirteen squares, according to the position of the diagonal on which
it is placed. And it is well here to state that when we speak of
"diagonals" in connection with the chessboard, we do not limit
ourselves to the two long diagonals from corner to corner, but include
all the shorter lines that are parallel to these. To prevent
misunderstanding on future occasions, it will be well for the reader
to note carefully this fact.</p>

<p>The greatest number of bishops that can be placed at the same time on
the chessboard, without any bishop attacking another, is fourteen. I
show, in diagram, the simplest way of doing this. In fact, on a square
chequered board of any number of squares the greatest number of
bishops that can be placed without attack is always two less than
twice the number of squares on the side. It is an interesting puzzle
to discover in just how many different ways the fourteen bishops may
be so placed without mutual attack. I shall give an exceedingly simple
rule for determining the number of ways for a square chequered board
of any number of squares.</p>

<p>The queen is by far the strongest piece on the chessboard. If you
place her on one of the four squares in the centre of the board, she
attacks no fewer than twenty-seven other squares; and if you try to
hide her in a corner, she still attacks twenty-one squares. Eight
queens may be placed on the board so that no queen attacks another,
and it is an old puzzle (first proposed by Nauck in 1850, and it has
quite a little literature of its own) to discover in just how many
different ways this may be done. I show one way in the diagram, and
there are in all twelve of these fundamentally different ways. These
twelve produce ninety-two ways if we regard reversals and reflections
as different. The diagram is in a way a symmetrical arrangement. If
you turn the page upside down, it will reproduce itself exactly; but
if you look at it with one of the other sides at the bottom, you get
another way that is not identical. Then if you reflect these two ways
in a mirror you get two more ways. Now, all the other eleven solutions
are non-symmetrical, and therefore each of them may be presented in
eight ways by these reversals and reflections. It will thus be seen
why the twelve fundamentally different solutions produce only
ninety-two arrangements, as I have said, and not ninety-six, as would
happen if all twelve were non-symmetrical. It is well to have a clear
understanding on the matter of reversals and reflections when dealing
with puzzles on the chessboard.</p>

the two directions indicated by the dotted lines there are three
queens in a straight line. There is only one of the twelve fundamental

<p>The art of producing pictures or designs by means of joining together
pieces of hard substances, either naturally or artificially coloured,
is of very great antiquity. It was certainly known in the time of the
Pharaohs, and we find a reference in the Book of Esther to "a pavement
of red, and blue, and white, and black marble." Some of this ancient
work that has come down to us, especially some of the Roman mosaics,
would seem to show clearly, even where design is not at first evident,
that much thought was bestowed upon apparently disorderly
arrangements. Where, for example, the work has been produced with a
very limited number of colours, there are evidences of great ingenuity
in preventing the same tints coming in close proximity. Lady readers
who are familiar with the construction of patchwork quilts will know
how desirable it is sometimes, when they are limited in the choice of
material, to prevent pieces of the same stuff coming too near
together. Now, this puzzle will apply equally to patchwork quilts or
tesselated pavements.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the diagram how a square piece of flooring may be

tile, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Sixty-four such tiles

<p>If the reader will examine the above diagram, he will see that I have
so placed eight V's, eight E's, eight I's, and eight L's in the
diagram that no letter is in line with a similar one horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally. Thus, no V is in line with another V, no E
with another E, and so on. There are a great many different ways of
arranging the letters under this condition. The puzzle is to find an
arrangement that produces the greatest possible number of four-letter
words, reading upwards and downwards, backwards and forwards, or
diagonally. All repetitions count as different words, and the five
variations that may be used are: VEIL, VILE, LEVI, LIVE, and EVIL.</p>

<p>This will be made perfectly clear when I say that the above
arrangement scores eight, because the top and bottom row both give
VEIL; the second and seventh columns both give VEIL; and the two
diagonals, starting from the L in the 5th row and E in the 8th row,
both give LIVE and EVIL. There are therefore eight different readings
of the words in all.</p>

<p>This difficult word puzzle is given as an example of the use of
chessboard analysis in solving such things. Only a person who is
familiar with the "Eight Queens" problem could hope to solve it.</p>

two cards of the same suit or the same value. This in itself is easy
enough, but a point of the puzzle is to find in how many different

his modern edition of Bachet, gives the answer incorrectly. And yet
the puzzle is really quite easy. Any arrangement produces seven more
by turning the square round and reflecting it in a mirror. These are
counted as different by Bachet.</p>

(that is, in a straight line, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally
with) at least one of the crescents. The arrangement adopted by the
Byzantine architect was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/q312.png" width="400" height="402" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now, to cover up one of these five crescents was a capital offence,
the death being something very painful and lingering. But on a certain
occasion of festivity it was necessary to lay down on this pavement a
square carpet of the largest dimensions possible, and I have shown in
the illustration by dark shading the largest dimensions that would be
available.</p>

<p>The puzzle is to show how the architect, if he had foreseen this
question of the carpet, might have so arranged his five crescent tiles
in accordance with the required conditions, and yet have allowed for
the largest possible square carpet to be laid down without any one of
the five crescent tiles being covered, or any portion of them.</p>

Stars, five of the latter being hidden by the Planets. It will be
found that every Star, with the exception of the ten that have a black
spot in their centres, is in a straight line, vertically,
horizontally, or diagonally, with at least one of the Planets. The

line with one or more of them.</p>

<p>My friend Captain Potham Hall, the renowned hunter of big game, says
there is nothing more exhilarating than a brush with a herd&mdash;a
pack&mdash;a team&mdash;a flock&mdash;a swarm (it has taken me a full quarter of an
hour to recall the right word, but I have it at last)&mdash;a <i>pride</i> of
lions. Why a number of lions are called a "pride," a number of whales
a "school," and a number of foxes a "skulk" are mysteries of philology
into which I will not enter.</p>

<p>Well, the captain says that if a spirited lion crosses your path in
the desert it becomes lively, for the lion has generally been looking
for the man just as much as the man has sought the king of the forest.
And yet when they meet they always quarrel and fight it out. A little
contemplation of this unfortunate and long-standing feud between two
estimable families has led me to figure out a few calculations as to
the probability of the man and the lion crossing one another's path in
the jungle. In all these cases one has to start on certain more <span class='pagenum'>Pg 95<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>or
less arbitrary assumptions. That is why in the above illustration I
have thought it necessary to represent the paths in the desert with
such rigid regularity. Though the captain assures me that the tracks
of the lions usually run much in this way, I have doubts.</p>

<p>The puzzle is simply to find out in how many different ways the man
and the lion may be placed on two different spots that are not on the
same path. By "paths" it must be understood that I only refer to the
ruled lines. Thus, with the exception of the four corner spots, each
combatant is always on two paths and no more. It will be seen that
there is a lot of scope for evading one another in the desert, which
is just what one has always understood.</p>

<p>The knight is the irresponsible low comedian of the chessboard. "He is
a very uncertain, sneaking, and demoralizing rascal," says an American
writer. "He can only move two squares, but makes up in the quality of
his locomotion for its quantity, for he can spring one square sideways
and one forward simultaneously, like a cat; can stand on one leg in
the middle of the board and jump to any one of eight squares he
chooses; can get on one side of a fence and blackguard three or four
men on the other; has an objectionable way of inserting himself in
safe places where he can scare the king and compel him to move, and
then gobble a queen. For pure cussedness the knight has no equal, and
when you chase him out of one hole he skips into another." Attempts
have been made over and over again to obtain a short, simple, and
exact definition of the move of the knight&mdash;without success. It really
consists in moving one square like a rook, and then another square
like a bishop&mdash;the two operations being done in one leap, so that it
does not matter whether the first square passed over is occupied by
another piece or not. It is, in fact, the only leaping move in chess.
But difficult as it is to define, a child can learn it by inspection
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>I have shown in the diagram how twelve knights (the fewest possible
that will perform the feat) may be placed on the chessboard so that
every square is either occupied or attacked by a knight. Examine every
square in turn, and you will find that this is so. Now, the puzzle in
this case is to discover what is the smallest possible number of
knights that is required in order that every square shall be either
occupied or attacked, and every knight protected by another knight.
And how would you arrange them? It will be found that of the twelve
shown in the diagram only four are thus protected by being a knight's
move from another knight.</p>


<h2><a name="THE_GUARDED_CHESSBOARD" id="THE_GUARDED_CHESSBOARD"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE GUARDED CHESSBOARD.</a></h2>

<p>On an ordinary chessboard, 8 by 8, every square can be guarded&mdash;that
is, either occupied or attacked&mdash;by 5 queens, the fewest possible.
There are exactly 91 fundamentally different arrangements in which no
queen attacks another queen. If every queen must attack (or be
protected by) another queen, there are at fewest 41 arrangements, and
I have recorded some 150 ways in which some of the queens are attacked
and some not, but this last case is very difficult to enumerate
exactly.</p>

<p>On an ordinary chessboard every square can be guarded by 8 rooks (the
fewest possible) in 40,320 ways, if no rook may attack another rook,
but it is not known how many of these are fundamentally different.
(See solution to No. <a href="#X_295_THE_EIGHT_ROOKSa">295</a>, "<a href="#X_295_THE_EIGHT_ROOKSa">The Eight Rooks</a>.") I have not enumerated
the ways in which every rook shall be protected by another rook.</p>

<p>On an ordinary chessboard every square can be guarded by 8 bishops
(the fewest possible), if no bishop may attack another bishop. Ten
bishops are necessary if every bishop is to be protected. (See Nos.
<a href="#X_297_BISHOPSmdashUNGUARDED">297</a> and <a href="#X_298_BISHOPSmdashGUARDED">298</a>, "<a href="#X_297_BISHOPSmdashUNGUARDED">Bishops unguarded</a>" and "<a href="#X_298_BISHOPSmdashGUARDED">Bishops guarded</a>.")</p>

<p>On an ordinary chessboard every square can be guarded by 12 knights if
all but 4 are unprotected. But if every knight must be protected, 14
are necessary. (See No. <a href="#X_319_THE_KNIGHT-GUARDS">319</a>, "<a href="#X_319_THE_KNIGHT-GUARDS">The Knight-Guards</a>.")</p>

<h3>NON-ATTACKING CHESSBOARD ARRANGEMENTS.</h3>

<p>We know that n queens may always be placed on a square board of n<sup>2</sup>
squares (if n be greater than 3) without any queen attacking another
queen. But no general formula for enumerating the number of different
ways in which it may be done has yet been discovered; probably it is
undiscoverable. The known results are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Where n = 4 there is 1 fundamental solution and 2 in all.</p>

<p>Where n = 5 there are 2 fundamental solutions and 10 in all.</p>

<p>Where n = 6 there is 1 fundamental solution and 4 in all.</p>

<p>Where n = 7 there are 6 fundamental solutions and 40 in all.</p>

<p>Where n = 8 there are 12 fundamental solutions and 92 in all.</p>

<p>Where n = 9 there are 46 fundamental solutions.</p>

<p>Where n = 10 there are 92 fundamental solutions.</p>

<p>Where n = 11 there are 341 fundamental solutions.</p>

<p>Obviously n rooks may be placed without attack on an n<sup>2</sup> board in n!
ways, but how many of these are fundamentally different I have only
worked out in the four cases where n equals 2, 3, 4, and 5. The
answers here are respectively 1, 2, 7, and 23. (See No. <a href="#X_296_THE_FOUR_LIONS">296</a>, "<a href="#X_296_THE_FOUR_LIONS">The Four
Lions</a>.")</p>

<p>We can place 2n-2 bishops on an n<sup>2</sup> board in 2<sup>n</sup> ways. (See No.
<a href="#X_299_BISHOPS_IN_CONVOCATION">299</a>, "<a href="#X_299_BISHOPS_IN_CONVOCATION">Bishops in Convocation</a>.") For boards containing 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8 squares, on a side there are respectively 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 20, 36
fundamentally different arrangements. Where n is odd there are
2<sup>&frac12;(n-1)</sup> such arrangements, each giving 4 by reversals and
reflections, and 2<sup>n-3</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;2<sup>&frac12;(n-3)</sup> giving 8. Where n is even there
are 2<sup>&frac12;(n-2)</sup>, each giving 4 by reversals and reflections, and
2<sup>n-3</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;2<sup>&frac12;(n-4)</sup>, each giving 8.</p>

<p>We can place &frac12;(n<sup>2</sup>+1) knights on an n<sup>2</sup> board without attack, when
n is odd, in 1 fundamental way; and &frac12;n<sup>2</sup> knights on an n<sup>2</sup> board,
when n is even, in 1 fundamental way. In the first case we place all
the knights on the same colour as the central square; in the second
case we place them all on black, or all on white, squares.</p>


<h3>THE TWO PIECES PROBLEM.</h3>

<p>On a board of n<sup>2</sup> squares, two queens, two rooks, two bishops, or
two knights can always be placed, irrespective of attack or not, in
&frac12;(n<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;n<sup>2</sup>) ways. The following formul&aelig; will show in how many of
these ways the two pieces may be placed with attack and without:&mdash;</p>

<p>The puzzle is to move the single rook over the whole board, so that it
shall visit every square of the board once, and only once, and end its
tour on the square from which it starts. You have to do this in as few
moves as possible, and unless you are very careful you will take just
one move too many. Of course, a square is regarded equally as
"visited" whether you merely pass over it or make it a stopping-place,
and we will not quibble over the point whether the original square is
actually visited twice. We will assume that it is not.</p>

makes twenty-one moves, in the course of which journey it visits every
square of the board once and only once, stopping at the square marked
10 at the end of its tenth move, and ending at the square marked 21.
Two consecutive moves cannot be made in the same direction&mdash;that is to

one of the deepest dungeons beneath the castle moat. It will be seen
from our illustration that there were sixty-three cells in the
dungeon, all connected by open doors, and the maiden was chained in
the cell in which she is shown. Now, a valiant knight, who loved the
damsel, succeeded in rescuing her from the enemy. Having gained an
entrance to the dungeon at the point where he is seen, he succeeded in
reaching the maiden after entering every cell once and only once. Take

<p>A French prisoner, for his sins (or other people's), was confined in
an underground dungeon containing sixty-four cells, all communicating
with open doorways, as shown in our illustration. In order to reduce
the tedium of his restricted life, he set himself various puzzles, and
this is one of them. Starting from the cell in which he is shown, how
could he visit every cell once, and only once, and make as many
turnings as possible? His first attempt is shown by the dotted track.
It will be found that there are as many as fifty-five straight lines

Christian in one corner cell and a lion in the diagonally opposite
corner and then leave them with all the inner doors open. The
consequent effect was sometimes most laughable. On one occasion the
man was given a sword. He was <span class='pagenum'>Pg 98<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>no coward, and was as anxious to find

<p>This is quite a fascinating little puzzle. Place eight bishops (four
black and four white) on the reduced chessboard, as shown in the
illustration. The problem is to make the black bishops change places
with the white ones, no bishop ever attacking another of the opposite
colour. They must move alternately&mdash;first a white, then a black, then
a white, and so on. When you have succeeded in doing it at all, try to
find the fewest possible moves.</p>

<p>If you leave out the bishops standing on black squares, and only play
on the white squares, you will discover my last puzzle turned on its
side.</p>

<p>The puzzle of making a complete tour of the chessboard with the queen
in the fewest possible moves (in which squares may be visited more
than once) was first given by the late Sam Loyd <span class='pagenum'>Pg 99<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>in his <i>Chess
Strategy</i>. But the solution shown below is the one he gave in
<i>American Chess-Nuts</i> in 1868. I have recorded at least six different
solutions in the minimum number of moves&mdash;fourteen&mdash;but this one is
the best of all, for reasons I will explain.</p>

<p>If you will look at the lettered square you will understand that there
are only ten really differently placed squares on a chessboard&mdash;those
enclosed by a dark line&mdash;all the others are mere reversals or
reflections. For example, every A is a corner square, and every J a
central square. Consequently, as the solution shown has a
turning-point at the enclosed D square, we can obtain a solution
starting from and ending at any square marked D&mdash;by just turning the
board about. Now, this scheme will give you a tour starting from any
A, B, C, D, E, F, or H, while no other route that I know can be
adapted to more than five different starting-points. There is no
Queen's Tour in fourteen moves (remember a tour must be re-entrant)
that may start from a G, I, or J. But we can have a non-re-entrant
path over the whole board in fourteen moves, starting from any given
square. Hence the following puzzle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

visit every square of the board in fourteen moves, ending wherever you

<p>Put the point of your pencil on one of the white stars and (without
ever lifting your pencil from the paper) strike out all the stars in
fourteen continuous straight strokes, ending at the second white star.
Your straight strokes may be in any direction you like, only every
turning must be made on a star. There is no objection to striking out
any star more than once.</p>

<p>In this case, where both your starting and ending squares are fixed
inconveniently, you cannot obtain a solution by breaking a Queen's
Tour, or in any other way by queen moves alone. But you are allowed to
use oblique straight lines&mdash;such as from the upper white star direct
to a corner star.</p>

from one black star, strike out all the stars in twelve straight

it in twelve? Every turning must be made on a star, and the lines must
be parallel to the sides and diagonals of the square, as shown. In

only queen moves (without going outside the boundary as in the last
case) are required.</p>

St. George wishes to kill the dragon. Killing dragons was a well-known
pastime of his, and, being a knight, it was only natural that he
should desire to perform the feat in a series of knight's moves. Can
you show how, starting from that central square, he may visit once,
and only once, every square of the board in a chain of chess knight's
moves, and end by capturing the dragon on his last move? Of course a
variety of different ways are open to him, so try to discover a route
that forms some pretty design when you have marked each successive
leap by a straight line from square to square.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful districts within easy distance of London for
a summer ramble is that part of Buckinghamshire known as the Valley of
the Chess&mdash;at least, it was a few years ago, before it was discovered
by the speculative builder. At the beginning of the present century
there lived, not far from Latimers, a worthy but eccentric farmer
named Lawrence. One of his queer notions was that every person who
lived near the banks of the river Chess ought to be in some way
acquainted with the noble game of the same name, and in order to
impress this fact on his men and his neighbours he adopted at times
strange terminology. For example, when one of his ewes presented him
with a lamb, he would say that it had "queened a pawn"; when he put up
a new barn against the highway, he called it "castling on the king's
side"; and when he sent a man with a gun to keep his neighbour's birds
off his fields, he spoke of it as "attacking his opponent's rooks."
Everybody in the neighbourhood used to be amused at Farmer Lawrence's
little jokes, and one boy (the wag of the village) who got his ears
pulled by the old gentleman for stealing his "chestnuts" went so far
as to call him "a silly old chess-protector!"</p>

<p>One year he had a large square field divided into forty-nine square
plots, as shown in the illustration. The white squares were sown with
wheat and the black squares with barley. When the harvest time came
round he gave orders that his men were first to cut the corn in the
patch marked 1, and that each successive cutting should be exactly a
knight's move from the last one, the thirteenth cutting being in the
patch marked 13, the twenty-fifth in the patch marked 25, the
thirty-seventh in the one marked 37, and the last, or forty-ninth
cutting, in the patch marked 49. This was too much for poor Hodge, and
each day Farmer Lawrence had to go down to the field and show which
piece had to be operated upon. But the problem will perhaps present no
difficulty to my readers.</p>

<p>In introducing a little Commonwealth problem, I must first explain
that the diagram represents the sixty-four fields, all properly fenced
off from one another, of an Australian settlement, though I need
hardly say that our kith and kin "down under" always <i>do</i> set out
their land in this methodical and exact manner. It will be seen that
in every one of the four corners is a kangaroo. Why kangaroos have a
marked preference for corner plots has never been satisfactorily
explained, and it would be out of place to discuss the point here. I
should also add that kangaroos, as is well known, always leap in what
we call "knight's moves." In fact, chess players would probably have
adopted the better term "kangaroo's move" had not chess been invented
before kangaroos.</p>

<p>The puzzle is simply this. One morning each kangaroo went for his
morning hop, and in sixteen consecutive knight's leaps visited just
fifteen different fields and jumped back to his corner. No field was
visited by more than one of the kangaroos. The diagram shows how they
arranged matters. What you are asked to do is to show how they might
have performed the feat without any kangaroo ever crossing the
horizontal line in the middle of the square that divides the board
into two equal parts.</p>

<p>We cannot divide the ordinary chessboard into four equal square
compartments, and describe a complete tour, or even path, in each
compartment. But we may divide it into four compartments, as in the
illustration, two containing each twenty squares, and the other two
each twelve squares, and so obtain an interesting puzzle. You are
asked to describe a complete re-entrant tour on this board, starting
where you like, but visiting every square in each successive
compartment before passing into another one, and making the final leap
back to the square from which the knight set out. It is not difficult,
but will be found very entertaining and not uninstructive.</p>

<p>Whether a re-entrant "tour" or a complete knight's "path" is possible
or not on a rectangular board of given dimensions depends not only on
its dimensions, but also on its shape. A tour is obviously not
possible on a board containing an odd number of cells, such as 5 by 5
or 7 by 7, for this reason: Every successive leap of the knight must
be from a white square to a black and a black to a white alternately.
But if there be an odd number of cells or squares there must be one
more square of one colour than of the other, therefore the path must
begin from a square of the colour that is in excess, and end on a
similar colour, and as a knight's <span class='pagenum'>Pg 103<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>move from one colour to a similar
colour is impossible the path cannot be re-entrant. But a perfect tour
may be made on a rectangular board of any dimensions provided the
number of squares be even, and that the number of squares on one side
be not less than 6 and on the other not less than 5. In other words,
the smallest rectangular board on which a re-entrant tour is possible
is one that is 6 by 5.</p>

<p>A complete knight's path (not re-entrant) over all the squares of a
board is never possible if there be only two squares on one side; nor
is it possible on a square board of smaller dimensions than 5 by 5. So
that on a board 4 by 4 we can neither describe a knight's tour nor a
complete knight's path; we must leave one square unvisited. Yet on a
board 4 by 3 (containing four squares fewer) a complete path may be
described in sixteen different ways. It may interest the reader to
discover all these. Every path that starts from and ends at different
squares is here counted as a different solution, and even reverse
routes are called different.</p>

<p>I will repeat that if a chessboard be cut into four equal parts, as
indicated by the dark lines in the illustration, it is not possible to
perform a knight's tour, either re-entrant or not, on one of the
parts. The best re-entrant attempt is shown, in which each knight has
to trespass twice on other parts. The puzzle is to cut the board
differently into four parts, each of the same size and shape, so that
a re-entrant knight's tour may be made on each part. Cuts along the
dotted lines will not do, as the four central squares of the board
would be either detached or hanging on by a mere thread.</p>

<p>Some few years ago I happened to read somewhere that Abnit
Vandermonde, a clever mathematician, who was born in 1736 and died in
1793, had devoted a good deal of study to the question of knight's
tours. Beyond what may be gathered from a few fragmentary references,
I am not aware of the exact nature or results of his investigations,
but one thing attracted my attention, and that was the statement that
he had proposed the question of a tour of the knight over the six
surfaces of a cube, each surface being a chessboard. Whether he
obtained a solution or not I do not know, but I have never seen one
published. So I at once set to work to master this interesting
problem. Perhaps the reader may like to attempt it.</p>

toadstool, until they have exchanged places, the white frogs being
left on 6 and 8 and the black ones on 1 and 3. If you use four
counters on a simple diagram, you will find this quite easy, but it is
a little more puzzling to do it in only seven plays, any number of
successive moves by one frog counting as one play. Of course, more
than one frog cannot be on a toadstool at the same time.</p>

<p>The following puzzle has an added interest from the circumstance that
a correct solution of it secured for a certain young Chinaman the hand
of his charming bride. The wealthiest mandarin within a radius of a
hundred miles of Peking was Hi-Chum-Chop, and his beautiful daughter,
Peeky-Bo, had innumerable admirers. One of her most ardent lovers was
Winky-Hi, and when he asked the old mandarin for his consent to their
marriage, Hi-Chum-Chop presented him with the following puzzle and
promised his consent if the youth brought him the correct answer
within a week. Winky-Hi, following a habit which obtains among certain
<span class='pagenum'>Pg 104<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>solvers to this day, gave it to all his friends, and when he had
compared their solutions he handed in the best one as his own. Luckily
it was quite right. The mandarin thereupon fulfilled his promise. The
fatted pup was killed for the wedding feast, and when Hi-Chum-Chop
passed Winky-Hi the liver wing all present knew that it was a token of
eternal goodwill, in accordance with Chinese custom from time
immemorial.</p>

<p>The mandarin had a table divided into twenty-five squares, as shown in
the diagram. On each of twenty-four of these squares was placed a
numbered counter, just as I have indicated. The puzzle is to get the
counters in numerical order by moving them one at a time in what we
call "knight's moves." Counter 1 should be where 16 is, 2 where 11 is,
4 where 13 now is, and so on. It will be seen that all the counters on
shaded squares are in their proper positions. Of course, two counters
may never be on a square at the same time. Can you perform the feat in
the fewest possible moves?</p>

<p>In order to make the manner of moving perfectly clear I will point out
that the first knight's move can only be made by 1 or by 2 or by 10.
Supposing 1 moves, then the next move must be by 23, 4, 8, or 21. As
there is never more than one square vacant, the order in which the
counters move may be written out as follows: 1&mdash;21&mdash;14&mdash;18&mdash;22, etc. A
rough diagram should be made on a larger scale for practice, and
numbered counters or pieces of cardboard used.</p>

<p>The following is the plan of the north wing of a certain gaol, showing
the sixteen cells all communicating by open doorways. Fifteen
prisoners were numbered and arranged in the cells as shown. They were

<p>Now, in order to reduce their growing obesity, and to combine physical
exercise with mental recreation, the prisoners decided, on the
suggestion of one of their number who was interested in knight's
tours, to try to form themselves into a perfect knight's path without
breaking the prison regulations, and leaving the bottom right-hand
corner cell vacant, as originally. The joke of the matter is that the
arrangement at which they arrived was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The warders failed to detect the important fact that the men could not
possibly get into this position without two of them having been at
some time in the same cell together. Make the attempt with counters on
a ruled diagram, and you will find that this is so. Otherwise the
solution is correct enough, each member being, as required, a knight's
move from the preceding number, and the original corner cell vacant.</p>

<p>The puzzle is to start with the men placed as in the illustration and
show how it might have been done in the fewest moves, while giving a
complete rest to as many prisoners as possible.</p>

<p>As there is never more than one vacant cell for a man to enter, it is
only necessary to write down the numbers of the men in the order in
which they move. It is clear that very few men can be left throughout
in their cells undisturbed, but I will leave the solver to discover

<p>A man has twenty-five dog kennels all communicating with each other by
doorways, as shown in the illustration. He wishes to arrange his
twenty dogs so that they shall form a knight's string from dog No. 1
to dog No. 20, the bottom row of five kennels to be left empty, as at
present. This is to be done by moving one dog at a time into a vacant
kennel. The dogs are well trained to obedience, and may be trusted to
remain in the kennels in which they are placed, except that if two are
placed in the same kennel together they will fight it out to the
death. How is the puzzle to be solved in the fewest possible moves
without two dogs ever being together?</p>

<p>Here is a neat little puzzle in counting. In how many different ways
may the two pawns advance to the eighth square? You may move them in
any order you like to form a different sequence. For example, you may
move the Q R P (one or two squares) first, or the K R P first, or one
pawn as far as you like before touching the other. Any sequence is
permissible, only in this puzzle as soon as a pawn reaches the eighth
square it is dead, and remains there unconverted. Can you count the
number of different sequences? At first it will strike you as being
very difficult, but I will show that it is really quite simple when
properly attacked.</p>

<p>In a game of chess between Mr. Black and Mr. White, Black was in
difficulties, and as usual was obliged to catch a train. So he
proposed that White should complete the game in his absence on
condition that no moves whatever <span class='pagenum'>Pg 107<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>should be made for Black, but only
with the White pieces. Mr. White accepted, but to his dismay found it
utterly impossible to win the game under such conditions. Try as he
would, he could not checkmate his opponent. On which square did Mr.
Black leave his king? The other pieces are in their proper positions
in the diagram. White may leave Black in check as often as he likes,
for it makes no difference, as he can never arrive at a checkmate

<p>Here is a little game of solitaire that is quite easy, but not so easy
as to be uninteresting. You can either rule out the squares on a sheet
of cardboard or paper, or you can use a portion <span class='pagenum'>Pg 108<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>of your chessboard. I

<p>The puzzle is to remove all the counters except one, and this one that
is left must be No. 1. You remove a counter by jumping over another
counter to the next space beyond, if that square is vacant, but you
cannot make a leap in a diagonal direction. The following moves will
make the play quite clear: 1-9, 2-10, 1-2, and so on. Here 1 jumps
over 9, and you remove 9 from the board; then 2 jumps over 10, and you
remove 10; then 1 jumps over 2, and you remove 2. Every move is thus a
capture, until the last capture of all is made by No. 1.</p>

or counters. In the illustration numbered counters are used. The
puzzle is to remove all the counters except two, and these two must
have originally been on the same side of the board; that is, the two
left must either belong to the group 1 to 16 or to the other group, 17
to 32. You remove a counter by jumping over it with another counter to
the next square beyond, if that square is vacant, but you cannot make
a leap in a diagonal direction. The following moves will make the play
quite clear: 3-11, 4-12, 3-4, 13-3. Here 3 jumps over 11, and you
remove 11; 4 jumps over 12, and you remove 12; and so on. It will be
found a fascinating little game of patience, and the solution requires
the exercise of some ingenuity.</p>

<p>One Christmas Eve I was travelling by rail to a little place in one of
the southern counties. The compartment was very full, and the
passengers were wedged in very tightly. My neighbour in one of the
corner seats was closely studying a position set up on one of those
little folding chessboards that can be carried conveniently in the
pocket, and I could scarcely avoid looking at it myself. Here is the
position:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/q361.png" width="400" height="445" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>My fellow-passenger suddenly turned his head and caught the look of
bewilderment on my face.</p>

<p>"Do you play chess?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, a little. What is that? A problem?"</p>

<p>"Problem? No; a game."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" I exclaimed rather rudely. "The position is a perfect
monstrosity!"</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a postcard and handed it to me. It bore an
address at one side and on the other the words "43. K to Kt 8."</p>

<p>"It is a correspondence game." he exclaimed. "That is my friend's last
move, and I am considering my reply."</p>

<p>"But you really must excuse me; the position seems utterly impossible.
How on earth, for example&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" he broke in smilingly. "I see; you are a beginner; you play to
win."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 109<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>"Of course you wouldn't play to lose or draw!"</p>

<p>He laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"You have much to learn. My friend and myself do not play for results
of that antiquated kind. We seek in chess the wonderful, the
whimsical, the weird. Did you ever see a position like that?"</p>

<p>I inwardly congratulated myself that I never had.</p>

<p>"That position, sir, materializes the sinuous evolvements and
syncretic, synthetic, and synchronous concatenations of two cerebral
individualities. It is the product of an amphoteric and intercalatory
interchange of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you seen the evening paper, sir?" interrupted the man opposite,
holding out a newspaper. I noticed on the margin beside his thumb some
pencilled writing. Thanking him, I took the paper and read&mdash;"Insane,
but quite harmless. He is in my charge."</p>

<p>After that I let the poor fellow run on in his wild way until both got
out at the next station.</p>

<p>But that queer position became fixed indelibly in my mind, with
Black's last move 43. K to Kt 8; and a short time afterwards I found
it actually possible to arrive at such a position in forty-three
moves. Can the reader construct such a sequence? How did White get his
rooks and king's bishop into their present positions, considering
Black can never have moved his king's bishop? No odds were given, and
every move was perfectly legitimate.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>Measure for Measure</i>, v. 1.</span><br />
</p>


<p>Apparently the first printed puzzle involving the measuring of a given
quantity of liquid by pouring from one vessel to others of known
capacity was that propounded by Niccola Fontana, better known as
"Tartaglia" (the stammerer), 1500-1559. It consists in dividing 24 oz.
of valuable balsam into three equal parts, the only measures available
being vessels holding 5, 11, and 13 ounces respectively. There are
many different solutions to this puzzle in six manipulations, or
pourings from one vessel to another. Bachet de M&eacute;ziriac reprinted this
and other of Tartaglia's puzzles in his <i>Probl&egrave;mes plaisans et
d&eacute;lectables</i> (1612). It is the general opinion that puzzles of this
class can only be solved by trial, but I think formul&aelig; can be
constructed for the solution generally of certain related cases. It is
a practically unexplored field for investigation.</p>

<p>The classic weighing problem is, of course, that proposed by Bachet.
It entails the determination of the least number of weights that would
serve to weigh any integral number of pounds from 1 lb. to 40 lbs.
inclusive, when we are allowed to put a weight in either of the two
pans. The answer is 1, 3, 9, and 27 lbs. Tartaglia had previously
propounded the same puzzle with the condition that the weights may
only be placed in one pan. The answer in that case is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,
32 lbs. Major MacMahon has solved the problem quite generally. A full
account will be found in Ball's <i>Mathematical Recreations</i> (5th
edition).</p>

<p>Packing puzzles, in which we are required to pack a maximum number of
articles of given dimensions into a box of known dimensions, are, I
believe, of quite recent introduction. At least I cannot recall any
example in the books of the old writers. One would rather expect to
find in the toy shops the idea presented as a mechanical puzzle, but I
do not think I have ever seen such a thing. The nearest approach to it
would appear to be the puzzles of the jig-saw character, where there
is only one depth of the pieces to be adjusted.</p>

requires the fewest possible manipulations, every separate pouring
from one vessel to another, or down a man's throat, counting as a

<p>As we all know by experience, considerable ingenuity is often
required in packing articles into a box if space is not to be unduly
wasted. A man once told me that he had a large number of iron balls, all
exactly two inches in diameter, and he wished to pack as many of these
as possible into a rectangular box 24<sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inches long, 22<sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> inches

that he could pack into that box?</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>Times</i> newspaper was invited by a high Russian
official to inspect the gold stored in reserve at St. Petersburg, in
order that he might satisfy himself that it was not another "Humbert
safe." He replied that it would be of no use whatever, for although
the gold might appear to be there, he would be quite unable from a
mere inspection to declare that what he saw was really gold. A
correspondent of the <i>Daily Mail</i> thereupon took up the challenge,
but, although he was greatly impressed by what he saw, he was
compelled to confess his incompetence (without emptying and counting
the contents of every box and sack, and assaying every piece of gold)
to give any assurance on the subject. In presenting the following
little puzzle, I wish it to be also understood that I do not guarantee
the real existence of the gold, and the point is not at all material
to our purpose. Moreover, if the reader says that gold is not usually
"put up" in slabs of the dimensions that I give, I can only claim
problematic licence.</p>

<p>Russian officials were engaged in packing 800 gold slabs, each
measuring 12½ inches long, 11 inches wide, and 1 inch deep. What
are the interior dimensions of a box of equal length and width, and
necessary depth, that will exactly contain them without any space
being left over? Not more than twelve slabs may be laid on edge,
according to the rules of the government. It is an interesting little
problem in packing, and not at all difficult.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was an aged merchant of Bagdad who was much
respected by all who knew him. He had three sons, and it was a rule of
his life to treat them all exactly alike. Whenever one received a
present, the other two were each given one of equal value. One day
this worthy man fell sick and died, bequeathing all his possessions to
his three sons in equal shares.</p>

<p>The only difficulty that arose was over the stock of honey. There were
exactly twenty-one barrels. The old man had left instructions that not
only should every son receive an equal quantity of honey, but should
receive exactly the same number of barrels, and that no honey should
be transferred from barrel to barrel on account of the waste involved.
Now, as seven of these barrels were full of honey, seven were
half-full, and seven were empty, this was found to be quite a puzzle,
especially as each brother objected to taking more than four barrels
of, the same description&mdash;full, half-full, or empty. Can you show how
they succeeded in making a correct division of the property?</p>

<p>This is another medi&aelig;val class of puzzles. Probably the earliest
example was by Abbot Alcuin, who was born in Yorkshire in 735 and died
at Tours in 804. And everybody knows the story of the man with the
wolf, goat, and basket of cabbages whose boat would only take one of
the three at a time with the man himself. His difficulties arose from
his being unable to leave the wolf alone with the goat, or the goat
alone with the cabbages. These puzzles were considered by Tartaglia
and Bachet, and have been later investigated by Lucas, De Fonteney,
Delannoy, Tarry, and others. In the puzzles I give there will be found
one or two new conditions which add to the complexity somewhat. I also

weighed 75 lbs. And then there was the dog, who could not be induced
on any terms to swim. On the principle of "ladies first," they at once
sent Mrs. Softleigh over; but this was a stupid oversight, because she
had to come back again with the boat, so nothing was gained by that
operation. How did they all succeed in getting across? The reader will

<p>Many years ago, in the days of the smuggler known as "Rob Roy of the
West," a piratical band buried on the coast of South Devon a quantity
of treasure which was, of course, abandoned by them in the usual
inexplicable way. Some time afterwards its whereabouts was discovered
by three countrymen, who visited the spot one night and divided the
spoil between them, Giles taking treasure to the value of &pound;800, Jasper
&pound;500 worth, and Timothy &pound;300 worth. In returning they had to cross the
river Axe at a point where they had left a small boat in readiness.
Here, however, was a difficulty they had not anticipated. The boat
would only carry two men, or one man and a sack, and they had so
little confidence in one another that no person could be left alone on
the land or in the boat with more than his share of the spoil, though
two persons (being a check on each other) might be left with more than
their shares. The puzzle is to show how they got over the river in the
fewest possible crossings, taking their treasure with them. No

<p>Colonel B&mdash;&mdash; was a widower of a very taciturn disposition. His
treatment of his four daughters was unusually severe, almost cruel,
and they not unnaturally felt disposed to resent it. Being charming
girls with every virtue and many accomplishments, it is not surprising
that each had a fond admirer. But the father forbade the young men to
call at his house, intercepted all letters, and placed his daughters
under stricter supervision than ever. But love, which scorns locks and
keys and garden walls, was equal to the occasion, and the four youths
conspired together and planned a general elopement.</p>

<p>At the foot of the tennis lawn at the bottom of the garden ran the
silver Thames, and one night, after the four girls had been safely
conducted from a dormitory window to <i>terra firma</i>, they all crept
softly down to the bank of the river, where a small boat belonging to
the Colonel was moored. With this they proposed to cross to the
opposite side and make their way to a lane where conveyances were
waiting to carry them in their flight. Alas! here at the water's brink
their difficulties already began.</p>

<p>The young men were so extremely jealous that not one of them would
allow his prospective bride to remain at any time in the company of
another man, or men, unless he himself were present also. Now, the
boat would only hold two persons, though it could, of course, be rowed
by one, and it seemed impossible that the four couples would ever get
across. But midway in the stream was a small island, and this seemed
to present a way out of the difficulty, because a person or persons
could be left there while the boat was rowed back or to the opposite
shore. If they had been prepared for their difficulty they could have
easily worked out a solution to the little poser at any other time.
But they were now so hurried and excited in their flight that the
confusion they soon got into was exceedingly amusing&mdash;or would have
been to any one except themselves.</p>

<p>As a consequence they took twice as long and crossed the river twice
as often as was really necessary. Meanwhile, the Colonel, who was a
very light sleeper, thought he heard a splash of oars. He quickly
raised the alarm among his household, and the young ladies were found
to be missing. Somebody was sent to the police-station, and a number
of officers soon aided in the pursuit of the fugitives, who, in
consequence of that delay in crossing the river, were quickly
overtaken. The four girls returned sadly to their homes, and
afterwards broke off their engagements in disgust.</p>

<p>For a considerable time it was a mystery how the party of eight
managed to cross the river in that little boat without any girl being
ever left with a man, unless her betrothed was also present. The
favourite method is to take eight counters or pieces of cardboard and
mark them A, B, C, D, a, b, c, d, to represent the four men and their
prospective brides, and carry them from one side of a table to the
other in a matchbox (to represent the boat), a penny being placed in
the middle of the table as the island.</p>

<p>Readers are now asked to find the quickest method of getting the party
across the river. How many passages are necessary from land to land?
By "land" is understood either shore or island. Though the boat would
not necessarily call at the island every time of crossing, the
possibility of its doing so must be provided for. For example, it
would not do for a man to be alone in the boat (though it were
understood that he intended merely to cross from one bank to the
opposite one) if there happened to be a girl alone on the island other
than the one to whom he was engaged.</p>

<p>The ingenious manner in which a box of treasure, consisting
principally of jewels and precious stones, was stolen from Gloomhurst
Castle has been handed down as a tradition in the De Gourney family.
The thieves consisted of a man, a youth, and a small boy, whose only
mode of escape with the box of treasure was by means of a high window.
Outside the window was fixed a pulley, over which ran a rope with a
basket at each end. When one basket was on the ground the other was at
the window. The rope was so disposed that the persons in the basket
could neither help themselves by means of it nor receive help from
others. In short, the only way the baskets could be used was by
placing a heavier weight in one than in the other.</p>

<p>Now, the man weighed 195 lbs., the youth 105 lbs., the boy 90 lbs.,
and the box of treasure 75 lbs. The weight in the descending basket
could not exceed that in the other by more than 15 lbs. without
causing a descent so rapid as to be most dangerous to a human being,
though it would not injure the stolen property. Only two persons, or
one person and the treasure, could be placed in the same basket at one
time. How did they all manage to escape and take the box of treasure
with them?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 114<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>The puzzle is to find the shortest way of performing the feat, which
in itself is not difficult. Remember, a person cannot help himself by
hanging on to the rope, the only way being to go down "with a bump,"
with the weight in the other basket as a counterpoise.</p>

dominoes are so arranged in proper sequence (that is, with 1 against
1, 2 against 2, and so on), that the total number of pips on the two
end dominoes is five, and the sum of the pips on the three dominoes in

44. The pips in the other two sides sum to 59 and 32 respectively. The
puzzle is to rearrange the dominoes in the same form so that all of

<p>In the illustration we have a frame constructed from the ten playing
cards, ace to ten of diamonds. The children who made it wanted the
pips on all four sides to add up alike, but they failed in their
attempt and gave it up as impossible. It will be seen that the pips in
the <span class='pagenum'>Pg 115<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>top row, the bottom row, and the left-hand side all add up 14,
but the right-hand side sums to 23. Now, what they were trying to do
is quite possible. Can you rearrange the ten cards in the same
formation so that all four sides shall add up alike? Of course they
need not add up 14, but any number you choose to select.</p>

about this result? It will be seen that, without affecting the
solution, we may exchange the 5 with the 6, the 5 with the 7, the 8
with the 3, and so on. Also we may make the horizontal and the
vertical bars change places. But such obvious manipulations as these
are not to be regarded as different solutions. They are all mere
variations of one fundamental solution. Now, how many of these
fundamentally different solutions are there? The pips need not, of
course, always add up 23.</p>

<p>An entertaining little puzzle with cards is to take the nine cards of
a suit, from ace to nine inclusive, and arrange them in the form of
the letter "T," as shown in the illustration, so that the pips in the
horizontal line shall count the same as those in the column. In the
example given they add up twenty-three both ways. Now, it is quite
easy to get a single correct arrangement. The puzzle is to discover in
just how many different ways it may be done. Though the number is
high, the solution is not really difficult if we attack the puzzle in
the right manner. The reverse way obtained by reflecting the
illustration in a mirror we will not count as different, but all other
changes in the relative positions of the cards will here count. How
many different ways are there?</p>

<p>Here you pick out the nine cards, ace to nine of diamonds, and arrange
them in the form of a triangle, exactly as shown in the illustration,
so that the pips add up the same on the three sides. In the example
given it will be seen that they sum to 20 on each side, but the
particular number is of no importance so long as it is the same on all
three sides. The puzzle <span class='pagenum'>Pg 116<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>is to find out in just how many different
ways this can be done.</p>

<p>If you simply turn the cards round so that one of the other two sides
is nearest to you this will not count as different, for the order will
be the same. Also, if you make the 4, 9, 5 change places with the 7,
3, 8, and at the same time exchange the 1 and the 6, it will not be
different. But if you only change the 1 and the 6 it will be
different, because the order round the triangle is not the same. This
explanation will prevent any doubt arising as to the conditions.</p>

the next higher value&mdash;an ace on a two, a two on a three, and so on.
Patience is required to discover the shortest way of doing this. When
there are four vacant spaces you can pile four cards in seven moves,
with only three spaces you can pile them in nine moves, and with two
spaces you cannot pile more than two cards. When you have a grasp of
these and similar facts you will be able to remove a number of cards
bodily and write down 7, 9, or whatever the number of moves may be.
The gradual shortening of play is fascinating, and first attempts are
surprisingly lengthy.</p>

<p>Here is a neat little trick with three dice. I ask you to throw the
dice without my seeing them. Then I tell you to multiply the points of
the first die by 2 and add 5; then multiply the result by 5 and add
the points of the second die; then multiply the result by 10 and add
the points of the third die. You then give me the total, and I can at
once tell you the points thrown with the three dice. How do I do it?
As an example, if you threw 1, 3, and 6, as in the illustration, the
result you would give me would be 386, from which I could at once say
what you had thrown.</p>

<p>In a cricket match, Dingley Dell <i>v</i>. All Muggleton, the latter had
the first innings. Mr. Dumkins and Mr. Podder were at the wickets,
when the wary Dumkins made a splendid late cut, and Mr. Podder called
on him to run. Four runs were apparently completed, but the vigilant
umpires at each end called, "three short," making six short runs in
all. What number did Mr. Dumkins score? When Dingley Dell took their
turn at the wickets their champions were Mr. Luffey and Mr. Struggles.
The latter made a magnificent off-drive, and invited his colleague to
"come along," with the result that the observant spectators applauded
them for what was supposed to have been three sharp runs. But the
umpires declared that there had been two short runs at each end&mdash;four
in all. To what extent, if any, did this man&#339;uvre increase Mr.
Struggles's total?</p>

team were at the wickets all day, the last man being put out a few
minutes before the time for drawing stumps. The play was so slow that
most of the spectators were fast asleep, and, on being awakened by one
of the officials clearing the ground, we learnt that two men had been
put out leg-before-wicket for a combined score of 19 runs; four men
were caught for a combined score or 17 runs; one man was run out for a
duck's egg; and the others were all bowled for 3 runs each. There were
no extras. We were not told which of the men was the captain, but he
made exactly 15 more than the average of his team. What was the
captain's score?</p>

<p>There are no morals in puzzles. When we are solving the old puzzle of
the captain who, having to throw half his crew overboard in a storm,
arranged to draw lots, but so placed the men that only the Turks were
sacrificed, and all the Christians left on board, we do not stop to
discuss the questionable morality of the proceeding. And when we are
dealing with a measuring problem, in which certain thirsty pilgrims
are to make an equitable division of a barrel of beer, we do not
object that, as total abstainers, it is against our conscience to have
anything to do with intoxicating liquor. Therefore I make no apology
for introducing a puzzle that deals with betting.</p>

<p>Three horses&mdash;Acorn, Bluebottle, and Capsule&mdash;start in a race. The
odds are 4 to 1, Acorn; 3 to 1, Bluebottle; 2 to 1, Capsule. Now, how
much must I invest on each horse in order to win &pound;13, no matter which
horse comes in first? Supposing, as an example, that I betted &pound;5 on
each horse. Then, if Acorn won, I should receive &pound;20 (four times &pound;5),
and have to pay &pound;5 each for the other two horses; thereby winning &pound;10.
But it will be found that if Bluebottle was first I should only win
&pound;5, and if Capsule won I should gain nothing and lose nothing. This
will make the question perfectly clear to the novice, who, like
myself, is not interested in the calling of the fraternity who profess
to be engaged in the noble task of "improving the breed of horses."</p>

<p>Sometimes a quite simple statement of fact, if worded in an unfamiliar

will doubtless puzzle some of my more youthful readers just a little.
I happened to be at a motor-car race at Brooklands, when one spectator
said to another, while a number of cars were whirling round and round
the circular track:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's Gogglesmith&mdash;that man in the white car!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," was the reply; "but how many cars are running in this
race?"</p>

<p>Then came this curious rejoinder:&mdash;</p>

<p>"One-third of the cars in front of Gogglesmith added to three-quarters
of those behind him will give you the answer."</p>

<p>Now, can you tell how many cars were running in the race?</p>

</p>

<p>It may be said generally that a game is a contest of skill for two or
more persons, into which we enter either for amusement or to win a
prize. A puzzle is something to be done or solved by the individual.
For example, if it were possible for us so to master the complexities
of the game of chess that we could be assured of always winning with
the first or second move, as the case might be, or of always drawing,
then it would cease to be a game and would become a puzzle. Of course
among the young and uninformed, when the correct winning play is not
understood, a puzzle may well make a very good game. Thus there is no
doubt children will continue to play "Noughts and Crosses," though I
have shown (No. 109, "<i>Canterbury Puzzles</i>") that between two players
who both thoroughly understand the play, every game should be drawn.
Neither player could ever win except through the blundering of his
opponent. But I am writing from the point of view of the student of
these things.</p>

<p>The examples that I give in this class are apparently games, but,
since I show in every case how one player may win if he only play
correctly, they are in reality puzzles. Their interest, therefore,
lies in attempting to discover the leading method of play.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting little puzzle game that I used to play with an
acquaintance on the beach at Slocomb-on-Sea. Two players place an odd
number of pebbles, we will say fifteen, between them. Then each takes
in turn one, two, or three pebbles (as he chooses), and the winner is
the one who gets the odd number. Thus, if you get seven and your
opponent eight, you win. If you get six and he gets nine, he wins.
Ought the first or second player to win, and how? When you have
settled the question with fifteen pebbles try again with, say,
thirteen.</p>

<p><a name="X_393_THE_TWO_ROOKS" id="X_393_THE_TWO_ROOKS"></a><a href="#X_393_THE_TWO_ROOKSa"><b>393.&mdash;THE TWO ROOKS.</b></a></p>

<p>This is a puzzle game for two players. Each player has a single rook.
The first player places his rook on any square of the board that he
may choose to select, and then the second player does the same. They
now play in turn, the point of each play being to capture the
opponent's rook. But in this game you cannot play through a line of
attack without being captured. That is to say, if in the diagram it is
Black's turn to <span class='pagenum'>Pg 118<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>play, he cannot move his rook to his king's knight's
square, or to his king's rook's square, because he would enter the
"line of fire" when passing his king's bishop's square. For the same
reason he cannot move to his queen's rook's seventh or eighth squares.
Now, the game can never end in a draw. Sooner or later one of the
rooks must fall, unless, of course, both players commit the absurdity
of not trying to win. The trick of winning is ridiculously simple when
you know it. Can you solve the puzzle?</p>

<p>This variation of the last puzzle is also played by two persons. One
puts a counter on No. 6, and the other puts one on No. 55, and they
play alternately by removing the counter to any other number in a
line. If your opponent moves at any time on to one of the lines you
occupy, or even crosses one of your lines, you immediately capture him
and win. We will take an illustrative game.</p>

<p>A moves from 55 to 52; B moves from 6 to 13; A advances to 23; B goes
to 15; A retreats to 26; B retreats to 13; A advances to 21; B
retreats to 2; A advances to 7; B goes to 3; A moves to 6; B must now
go to 4; A establishes himself at 11, and B must be captured next move
because he is compelled to cross a line on which A stands. Play this
over and you will understand the game directly. Now, the puzzle part
of the game is this: Which player should win, and how many moves are
necessary?</p>

<p>Here is another puzzle game. One player, representing the British
general, places a counter at B, and the other player, representing the
enemy, places his counter at E. The Britisher makes the first advance
along one of the roads to the next town, then the enemy moves to one
of his nearest towns, and so on in turns, until the British general
gets into the same town as the enemy and captures him. Although each
must always move along a road to the next town only, and the second
player may do his utmost to avoid capture, the British general (as we
should suppose, from the analogy of real life) must infallibly win.
But how? That is the question.</p>

<p>Here is a little game that is childishly simple in its conditions. But
it is well worth investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. Stubbs pulled a small table between himself and his friend, Mr.
Wilson, and took a box of matches, from which he counted out thirty.</p>

<p>"Here are thirty matches," he said. "I <span class='pagenum'>Pg 119<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>divide them into three unequal
heaps. Let me see. We have 14, 11, and 5, as it happens. Now, the two
players draw alternately any number from any one heap, and he who
draws the last match loses the game. That's all! I will play with you,
Wilson. I have formed the heaps, so you have the first draw."</p>

<p>"As I can draw any number," Mr. Wilson said, "suppose I exhibit my
usual moderation and take all the 14 heap."</p>

<p>"That is the worst you could do, for it loses right away. I take 6
from the 11, leaving two equal heaps of 5, and to leave two equal
heaps is a certain win (with the single exception of 1, 1), because
whatever you do in one heap I can repeat in the other. If you leave 4
in one heap, I leave 4 in the other. If you then leave 2 in one heap,
I leave 2 in the other. If you leave only 1 in one heap, then I take
all the other heap. If you take all one heap, I take all but one in
the other. No, you must never leave two heaps, unless they are equal
heaps and more than 1, 1. Let's begin again."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Mr. Wilson. "I will take 6 from the 14, and
leave you 8, 11, 5."</p>

<p>Mr. Stubbs then left 8, 11, 3; Mr. Wilson, 8, 5, 3; Mr. Stubbs, 6, 5,
3; Mr. Wilson,4, 5, 3; Mr. Stubbs, 4, 5, 1; Mr. Wilson, 4, 3, 1; Mr.
Stubbs, 2, 3, 1; Mr. Wilson, 2, 1, 1; which Mr. Stubbs reduced to 1,
1, 1.</p>

<p>"It is now quite clear that I must win," said Mr. Stubbs, because you
must take 1, and then I take 1, leaving you the last match. You never
had a chance. There are just thirteen different ways in which the
matches may be grouped at the start for a certain win. In fact, the
groups selected, 14, 11, 5, are a certain win, because for whatever
your opponent may play there is another winning group you can secure,
and so on and on down to the last match."</p>

<p>It is said that the inhabitants of Montenegro have a little dice game
that is both ingenious and well worth investigation. The two players
first select two different pairs of odd numbers (always higher than 3)
and then alternately toss three dice. Whichever first throws the dice
so that they add up to one of his selected numbers wins. If they are
both successful in two successive throws it is a draw and they try
again. For example, one player may select 7 and 15 and the other 5 and
13. Then if the first player throws so that the three dice add up 7 or
15 he wins, unless the second man gets either 5 or 13 on his throw.</p>

<p>The puzzle is to discover which two pairs of numbers should be
selected in order to give both players an exactly even chance.</p>

<p>I once propounded the following puzzle in a London club, and for a
considerable period it absorbed the attention of the members. They
could make nothing of it, and considered it quite impossible of
solution. And yet, as I shall show, the answer is remarkably simple.</p>

<p>Two men are seated at a square-topped table. One places an ordinary
cigar (flat at one end, pointed at the other) on the table, then the
other does the same, and so on alternately, a condition being that no
cigar shall touch another. Which player should succeed in placing the
last cigar, assuming that they each will play in the best possible
manner? The size of the table top and the size of the cigar are not
given, but in order to exclude the ridiculous answer that the table
might be so diminutive as only to take one cigar, we will say that the
table must not be less than 2 feet square and the cigar not more than
4&frac12; inches long. With those restrictions you may take any dimensions
you like. Of course we assume that all the cigars are exactly alike in
every respect. Should the first player, or the second player, win?</p>

<p class='center'>
"By magic numbers."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">CONGREVE, <i>The Mourning Bride.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>This is a very ancient branch of mathematical puzzledom, and it has an
immense, though scattered, literature of its own. In their simple form
of consecutive whole numbers arranged in a square so that every
column, every row, and each of the two long diagonals shall add up
alike, these magic squares offer three main lines of investigation:
Construction, Enumeration, and Classification. Of recent years many
ingenious methods have been devised for the construction of magics,
and the law of their formation is so well understood that all the
ancient mystery has evaporated and there is no longer any difficulty
in making squares of any dimensions. Almost the last word has been
said on this subject. The question of the enumeration of all the
possible squares of a given order stands just where it did over two
hundred years ago. Everybody knows that there is only one solution for
the third order, three cells by three; and Fr&eacute;nicle published in 1693
diagrams of all the arrangements of the fourth order&mdash;880 in
number&mdash;and his results have been verified over and over again. I may
here refer to the general solution for this order, for numbers not
necessarily consecutive, by E. Bergholt in <i>Nature</i>, May 26, 1910, as
it is of the greatest importance to students of this subject. The
enumeration of the examples of any higher order is a completely
unsolved problem.</p>

<p>As to classification, it is largely a matter of individual
taste&mdash;perhaps an &aelig;sthetic question, for there is beauty in the law
and order of numbers. A man once said that he divided the human race
into two great classes: those who take snuff and those who do not. I
am not <span class='pagenum'>Pg 120<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>sure that some of our classifications of magic squares are not
almost as valueless. However, lovers of these things seem somewhat
agreed that Nasik magic squares (so named by Mr. Frost, a student of
them, after the town in India where he lived, and also called
Diabolique and Pandiagonal) and Associated magic squares are of
special interest, so I will just explain what these are for the
benefit of the novice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/msfig1.png" width="500" height="131" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>I published in <i>The Queen</i> for January 15, 1910, an article that would
enable the reader to write out, if he so desired, all the 880 magics
of the fourth order, and the following is the complete classification
that I gave. The first example is that of a Simple square that fulfils
the simple conditions and no more. The second example is a Semi-Nasik,
which has the additional property that the opposite short diagonals of
two cells each together sum to 34. Thus, 14&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;11&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;=&nbsp;34 and 12 +
6&nbsp;+&nbsp;13&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;34. The third example is not only Semi-Nasik but <span class='pagenum'>Pg 121<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>also
Associated, because in it every number, if added to the number that is
equidistant, in a straight line, from the centre gives 17. Thus, 1 +
16, 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;15, 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;14, etc. The fourth example, considered the most
"perfect" of all, is a Nasik. Here all the broken diagonals sum to 34.
Thus, for example, 15&nbsp;+&nbsp;14&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3, and 10&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;7&nbsp;+&nbsp;13, and 15&nbsp;+&nbsp;5 +
2&nbsp;+&nbsp;12. As a consequence, its properties are such that if you repeat
the square in all directions you may mark off a square, 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4,
wherever you please, and it will be magic.</p>

<p>The following table not only gives a complete enumeration under the
four forms described, but also a classification under the twelve
graphic types indicated in the diagrams. The dots at the end of each
line represent the relative positions of those complementary pairs, 1
+ 16, 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;15, etc., which sum to 17. For example, it will be seen that
the first and second magic squares given are of Type VI., that the
third square is of Type III., and that the fourth is of Type I.
Edouard Lucas indicated these types, but he dropped exactly half of
them and did not attempt the classification.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that every one of these squares will
produce seven others by mere reversals and reflections, which we do
not count as different. So that there are 7,040 squares of this order,
880 of which are fundamentally different.</p>

<p>An infinite variety of puzzles may be made introducing new conditions
into the magic square. In <i>The Canterbury Puzzles</i> I have given
examples of such squares with coins, with postage stamps, with
cutting-out conditions, and other tricks. I will now give a few

<p>Nearly everybody knows that a "magic square" is an arrangement of
numbers in the form of a square so that every row, every column, and
each of the two long diagonals adds up alike. For example, you would
find little difficulty in merely placing a different number in each of
the nine cells in the illustration so that the rows, columns, and
diagonals shall all add up 15. And at your first attempt you will
probably find that you have an 8 in one of the corners. The puzzle is
to construct the magic square, under the same conditions, with the 8
in the position shown.</p>

<p>I happened to have lying on my table a number of strips of cardboard,
with numbers printed on them from 1 upwards in numerical order. The
idea suddenly came to me, as ideas have a way of unexpectedly coming,
to make a little puzzle of this. I wonder whether many readers will
arrive at the same solution that I did.</p>

<p>Take seven strips of cardboard and lay them together as above. Then
write on each of them the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, as shown, so
that the numbers shall form seven rows and seven columns.</p>

<p>Now, the puzzle is to cut these strips into the fewest possible pieces
so that they may be placed together and form a magic square, the seven
rows, seven columns, and two diagonals adding up the same number. No
figures may <span class='pagenum'>Pg 122<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>be turned upside down or placed on their sides&mdash;that is,
all the strips must lie in their original direction.</p>

<p>Of course you could cut each strip into seven separate pieces, each
piece containing a number, and the puzzle would then be very easy, but
I need hardly say that forty-nine pieces is a long way from being the
fewest possible.</p>

<p>The illustration shows the plan of a prison of nine cells all
communicating with one another by doorways. The eight prisoners have
their numbers on their backs, and any one of them is allowed to
exercise himself in whichever cell may happen to be vacant, subject to
the rule that at no time shall two prisoners be in the same cell. The
merry monarch in whose dominions the prison was situated offered them
special comforts one Christmas Eve if, without breaking that rule,
they could so place themselves that their numbers should form a magic
square.</p>

<p>Now, prisoner No. 7 happened to know a good deal about magic squares,
so he worked out a scheme and naturally selected the method that was
most expeditious&mdash;that is, one involving the fewest possible moves
from cell to cell. But one man was a surly, obstinate fellow (quite
unfit for the society of his jovial companions), and he refused to
move out of his cell or take any part in the proceedings. But No. 7
was quite equal to the emergency, and found that he could still do
what was required in the fewest possible moves without troubling the
brute to leave his cell. The puzzle is to show how he did it and,
incidentally, to discover which prisoner was so stupidly obstinate.
Can you find the fellow?</p>

<p>Shortly after the episode recorded in the last puzzle occurred, a
ninth prisoner was placed in the vacant cell, and the merry monarch
then offered them all complete liberty on the following strange
conditions. They were required so to rearrange themselves in the cells
that their numbers formed a magic square without their movements
causing any two of them ever to be in the same cell together, except
that at the start one man was allowed to be placed on the shoulders of
another man, and thus add their numbers together, and move as one man.
For example, No. 8 might be placed on the shoulders of No. 2, and then
they would move about together as 10. The reader should seek first to
solve the puzzle in the fewest possible moves, and then see that the
man who is burdened has the least possible amount of work to do.</p>

<p>Not fifty miles from Cadiz stood in the middle ages a castle, all
traces of which have for centuries disappeared. Among other
interesting features, this castle contained a particularly unpleasant
dungeon divided into sixteen cells, all communicating with one
another, as shown in the illustration.</p>

<p>Now, the governor was a merry wight, and very fond of puzzles withal.
One day he went to the dungeon and said to the prisoners, "By my
halidame!" (or its equivalent in Spanish) "you shall all be set free
if you can solve this puzzle. You must so arrange yourselves in the
sixteen cells that the numbers on your backs shall form a magic square
in which every column, every row, and each of the two diagonals shall
add up the same. Only remember this: that in no case may two of you
ever be together in the same cell."</p>

<p>One of the prisoners, after working at the problem for two or three
days, with a piece of chalk, undertook to obtain the liberty of
himself and his fellow-prisoners if they would follow his directions
and move through the doorway <span class='pagenum'>Pg 123<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>from cell to cell in the order in which
he should call out their numbers.</p>

<p>The above is a trustworthy plan of a certain Russian prison in
Siberia. All the cells are numbered, and the prisoners are numbered
the same as the cells they occupy. The prison diet is so fattening
that these political prisoners are in perpetual fear lest, should
their pardon arrive, they might not be able to squeeze themselves
through the narrow doorways and get out. And of course it would be an
unreasonable thing to ask any government to pull down the walls of a
prison just to liberate the prisoners, however innocent they might be.
Therefore these men take all the healthy exercise they can in order to
retard their increasing obesity, and one of their recreations will
serve to furnish us with the following puzzle.</p>

<p>Show, in the fewest possible moves, how the sixteen men may form
themselves into a magic square, so that the numbers on their backs
shall add up the same in each of the four columns, four rows, and two
diagonals without two prisoners having been at any time in the same
cell together. I had better say, for the information of those who have
not yet been made acquainted with these places, that it is a
peculiarity of prisons that you are not allowed to go outside their
walls. Any prisoner may go any distance that is possible in a single
move.</p>

Now, with nine of the remainder (different suits are of no
consequence) form the above magic square. It will be seen that the
pips add up fifteen in every row in every column, and in each of the
two long diagonals. The puzzle is with the remaining cards (without
disturbing this arrangement) to form three more such magic squares, so
that each of the four shall add up to a different sum. There will, of
course, be four cards in the reduced pack that will not be used. These

The greatest possible summation is 23, and a solution for this number
may be easily obtained by substituting for every number its complement

<p>Although the adding magic square is of such great antiquity, curiously
enough the multiplying magic does not appear to have been mentioned
until the end of the eighteenth century, when it was referred to
slightly by one writer and then forgotten until I revived it in
<i>Tit-Bits</i> in 1897. The dividing magic was apparently first discussed
by me in <i>The Weekly Dispatch</i> in June 1898. The subtracting magic is
here introduced for the first time. It will now be convenient to deal
with all four kinds of magic squares together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/magicfig1.png" width="550" height="145" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>In these four diagrams we have examples in the third order of adding,
subtracting, multiplying, and dividing squares. In the first the
constant, 15, is obtained by the addition of the rows, columns, and
two diagonals. In the second case you get the constant, 5, by
subtracting the first number in a line from the second, and the result
from the third. You can, of course, perform the operation in either
direction; but, in order to avoid negative numbers, it is more
convenient simply to deduct the middle number from the sum of the two
extreme numbers. This is, in effect, the same thing. It will be seen
that the constant of the adding square is <i>n</i> times that of the
subtracting square derived from it, where <i>n</i> is the number of cells
in the side of square. And the manner of derivation here is simply to
reverse the two diagonals. Both squares are "associated"&mdash;a term I
have explained in the introductory article to this department.</p>

<p>The third square is a multiplying magic. The constant, 216, is
obtained by multiplying together the three numbers in any line. It is
"associated" by multiplication, instead of by addition. It is here
necessary to remark that in an adding square it is not essential that
the nine numbers should be consecutive. Write down any nine numbers in
this way&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='right'>1</td><td align='right'>3</td><td align='right'>5</td></tr>

<tr><td align='right'>7</td><td align='right'>9</td><td align='right'>11</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>so that the horizontal differences are all alike and the vertical
differences also alike (here 2 and 3), and these numbers will form an
adding magic square. By making the differences 1 and 3 we, of course,
get consecutive numbers&mdash;a particular case, and nothing more. Now, in
the case of the multiplying square we must take these numbers in
geometrical instead of arithmetical progression, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='right'>1</td><td align='right'>3</td><td align='right'>9</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>2</td><td align='right'>6</td><td align='right'>18</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>4</td><td align='right'>12</td><td align='right'>36</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Here each successive number in the rows is multiplied by 3, and in the
columns by 2. Had we multiplied by 2 and 8 we should get the regular
geometrical progression, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256, but I
wish to avoid high numbers. The numbers are arranged in the square in
the same order as in the adding square.</p>

<p>The fourth diagram is a dividing magic square. The constant 6 is here
obtained by dividing the second number in a line by the first (in
either direction) and the third number by the quotient. But, again,
the process is simplified by dividing the product of the two extreme
numbers by the middle number. This <span class='pagenum'>Pg 125<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>square is also "associated" by
multiplication. It is derived from the multiplying square by merely
reversing the diagonals, and the constant of the multiplying square is
the cube of that of the dividing square derived from it.</p>

<p>The next set of diagrams shows the solutions for the fifth order of
square. They are all "associated" in the same way as before. The
subtracting square is derived from the adding square by reversing the
diagonals and exchanging opposite numbers in the centres of the
borders, and the constant of one is again <i>n</i> times that of the other.
The dividing square is derived from the multiplying square in the same
way, and the constant of the latter is the 5th power (that is the
<i>n</i>th) of that of the former.</p>

<p>Construct a subtracting magic square with the first sixteen whole
numbers that shall be "associated" by <i>subtraction</i>. The constant is,
of course, obtained by subtracting the first number from the second in
line, the result from the third, and the result again from the fourth.
Also construct a dividing magic square of the same order that shall be

<p>While reading a French mathematical work I happened to come across,
the following statement: "A very remarkable magic square of 8, in two
degrees, has been constructed by M. Pfeffermann. In other words, he
has managed to dispose the sixty-four first numbers on the squares of
a chessboard in such a way that the sum of the numbers in every line,
every column, and in each of the two diagonals, shall be the same; and
more, that if one substitutes for all the numbers their squares, the
square still remains magic." I at once set to work to solve this
problem, and, although it proved a very hard nut, one was rewarded by
the discovery of some curious and beautiful laws that govern it. The
reader may like to try his hand at the puzzle.</p>

<h2><a name="MAGIC_SQUARES_OF_PRIMES" id="MAGIC_SQUARES_OF_PRIMES"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">MAGIC SQUARES OF PRIMES.</a></h2>

<p>The problem of constructing magic squares with prime numbers only was
first discussed by myself in <i>The Weekly Dispatch</i> for 22nd July and
5th August 1900; but during the last three or four years it has
received great attention from American mathematicians. First, they
have sought to form these squares with the lowest possible constants.
Thus, the first nine prime numbers, 1 to 23 inclusive, sum to 99,
which (being divisible by 3) is theoretically a suitable series; yet
it has been demonstrated that the lowest possible constant is 111, and
the required series as follows: 1, 7, 13, 31, 37, 43, 61, 67, and 73.
Similarly, in the case of the fourth order, the lowest series of
primes that are "theoretically suitable" will not serve. But in every
other order, up to the 12th inclusive, magic squares have been
constructed with the lowest series of primes theoretically possible.
And the 12th is the lowest order in which a straight series of prime
numbers, unbroken, from 1 upwards has been made to work. In other
words, the first 144 odd prime numbers have actually been arranged in
magic form. The following summary is taken from <i>The Monist</i> (Chicago)
for October 1913:&mdash;</p>

<p>This is the form in which I first introduced the question of magic
squares with prime numbers. I will here warn the reader that there is
a little trap.</p>

<p>A fruit merchant had nine baskets. Every basket contained plums (all
sound and ripe), and the number in every basket was different. When
placed as shown in the illustration they formed a magic square, so
that if he took any three baskets in a line in the eight possible
directions there would always be the same number of plums. This part
of the puzzle is easy enough to understand. But what follows seems at
first sight a little queer.</p>

<p>The merchant told one of his men to distribute the contents of any
basket he chose among some children, giving plums to every child so
that each should receive an equal number. But the man found it quite
impossible, no matter which basket he selected and no matter how many
children he included in the treat. Show, by giving contents of the
nine baskets, how this could come about.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Beauchamp Cholmondely Marjoribanks set out on his tour in
the Far East, he prided himself on his knowledge of magic squares, a
subject that he had made his special hobby; but he soon discovered
that he had never really touched more than the fringe of the subject,
and that the wily Chinee could <span class='pagenum'>Pg 127<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>beat him easily. I present a little
problem that one learned mandarin propounded to our traveller, as
depicted on the last page.</p>

<p>The Chinaman, after remarking that the construction of the ordinary
magic square of twenty-five cells is "too velly muchee easy," asked
our countryman so to place the numbers 1 to 25 in the square that
every column, every row, and each of the two diagonals should add up
65, with only prime numbers on the shaded "T." Of course the prime
numbers available are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23, so you
are at liberty to select any nine of these that will serve your
purpose. Can you construct this curious little magic square?</p>

<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>Paradise Lost.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>The Old English word "maze," signifying a labyrinth, probably comes
from the Scandinavian, but its origin is somewhat uncertain. The late
Professor Skeat thought that the substantive was derived from the
verb, and as in old times to be mazed or amazed was to be "lost in
thought," the transition to a maze in whose tortuous windings we are
lost is natural and easy.</p>

<p>The word "labyrinth" is derived from a Greek word signifying the
passages of a mine. The ancient mines of Greece and elsewhere inspired
fear and awe on account of their darkness and the danger of getting
lost in their intricate passages. Legend was afterwards built round
these mazes. The most familiar instance is the labyrinth made by
D&aelig;dalus in Crete for King Minos. In the centre was placed the
Minotaur, and no one who entered could find his way out again, but
became the prey of the monster. Seven youths and seven maidens were
sent regularly by the Athenians, and were duly devoured, until Theseus
slew the monster and escaped from the maze by aid of the clue of
thread provided by Ariadne; which accounts for our using to-day the
expression "threading a maze."</p>

<p>The various forms of construction of mazes include complicated ranges
of caverns, architectural labyrinths, or sepulchral buildings,
tortuous devices indicated by coloured marbles and tiled pavements,
winding paths cut in the turf, and topiary mazes formed by clipped
hedges. As a matter of fact, they may be said to have descended to us
in precisely this order of variety.</p>

<p>Mazes were used as ornaments on the state robes of Christian emperors
before the ninth century, and were soon adopted in the decoration of
cathedrals and other churches. The original idea was doubtless to
employ them as symbols of the complicated folds of sin by which man is
surrounded. They began to abound in the early part of the twelfth
century, and I give an illustration of one of this period in the
parish church at St. Quentin (Fig. 1). It formed a pavement of the
nave, and its diameter is 34&frac12; feet. The path here is the line itself.
If you place your pencil at the point A and ignore the enclosing line,
the line leads you to the centre by a long route over the entire area;
but you never have any option as to direction during your course. As
we shall find in similar cases, these early ecclesiastical mazes were
generally not of a puzzle nature, but simply long, winding paths that
took you over practically all the ground enclosed.</p>

<p>In the abbey church of St. Berlin, at St. Omer, is another of these
curious floors, representing the Temple of Jerusalem, with stations
for pilgrims. These mazes were actually visited and traversed by them
as a compromise for not going to the Holy Land in fulfilment of a vow.
They were also used as a means of penance, the penitent frequently
being directed to go the whole course of the maze on hands and knees.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 2.&mdash;Maze in Chartres Cathedral.</span>
</div>

<p>The maze in Chartres Cathedral, of which I give an illustration (Fig.
2), is 40 feet across, and was used by penitents following the
procession of Calvary. A labyrinth in Amiens Cathedral was octagonal,
similar to that at St. Quentin, measuring 42 feet across. It bore the
date 1288, but was destroyed in 1708. In the chapter-house at Bayeux
is a labyrinth formed of tiles, red, black, and encaustic, with a
pattern of brown and yellow. Dr. Ducarel, in his "<i>Tour through Part of
Normandy</i>" (printed in 1767), mentions the floor of the great
guard-chamber in the abbey of St. Stephen, at Caen, "the middle
whereof represents a maze or labyrinth about 10 feet diameter, and so
artfully contrived that, were we to suppose a man following all the
intricate meanders of its volutes, he could not travel less than a
mile before he got from one end to the other."</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 3.&mdash;Maze in Lucca Cathedral.</span>
</div>

<p>Then these mazes were sometimes reduced in size and represented on a
single tile (Fig. 3). I give an example from Lucca Cathedral. It is on
one of the porch piers, and is 19½ inches in diameter. A writer in
1858 says that, "from the continual attrition it has received from
thousands of tracing fingers, a central group of Theseus and the
Minotaur has now been very nearly effaced." Other examples were, and
perhaps still are, to be found in the Abbey of Toussarts, at
Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne, in the very ancient church of St. Michele at Pavia,
at Aix in Provence, in the cathedrals of Poitiers, Rheims, and Arras,
in the church of Santa Maria in Aquiro in Rome, in San Vitale at
Ravenna, in the Roman mosaic pavement found at Salzburg, and
elsewhere. These mazes were sometimes called "Chemins de Jerusalem,"
as being emblematical of the difficulties attending a journey to the
earthly Jerusalem and of those encountered by the Christian before he
can reach the heavenly Jerusalem&mdash;where the centre was frequently
called "Ciel."</p>

<p>Common as these mazes were upon the Continent, it is probable that no
example is to be found in any English church; at least I am not aware
of the existence of any. But almost every county has, or has had, its
specimens of <span class='pagenum'>Pg 129<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>mazes cut in the turf. Though these are frequently known
as "miz-mazes" or "mize-mazes," it is not uncommon to find them
locally called "Troy-towns," "shepherds' races," or "Julian's
Bowers"&mdash;names that are misleading, as suggesting a false origin. From
the facts alone that many of these English turf mazes are clearly
copied from those in the Continental churches, and practically all are
found close to some ecclesiastical building or near the site of an
ancient one, we may regard it as certain that they were of church
origin and not invented by the shepherds or other rustics. And
curiously enough, these turf mazes are apparently unknown on the
Continent. They are distinctly mentioned by Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>

<p>There was such a maze at Comberton, in Cambridgeshire, and another,
locally called the "miz-maze," at Leigh, in Dorset. The latter was on
the highest part of a field on the top of a hill, a quarter of a mile
from the village, and was slightly hollow in the middle and enclosed
by a bank about 3 feet high. It was circular, and was thirty paces in
diameter. In 1868 the turf had grown over the little trenches, and it
was then impossible to trace the paths of the maze. The Comberton one
was at the same date believed to be perfect, but whether either or
both have now disappeared I cannot say. Nor have I been able to verify
the existence or non-existence of the other examples of which I am
able to give illustrations. I shall therefore write of them all in the
past tense, retaining the hope that some are still preserved.</p>

<p>I give in Fig. 6 a maze that was at Alkborough, Lincolnshire,
overlooking the Humber. This was 44 feet in diameter, and the
resem<span class='pagenum'>Pg 130<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span>blance between it and the mazes at Chartres and Lucca (Figs. 2
and 3) will be at once perceived. A maze at Boughton Green, in
Nottinghamshire, a place celebrated at one time for its fair (Fig. 7),
was 37 feet in diameter. I also include the plan (Fig. 8) of one that
used to be on the outskirts of the village of Wing, near Uppingham,
Rutlandshire. This maze was 40 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>The maze that was on St. Catherine's Hill, Winchester, in the parish
of Chilcombe, was a poor specimen (Fig. 9), since, as will be seen,
there was one short direct route to the centre, unless, as in Fig. 10
again, the path is the line itself from end to end. This maze was 86
feet square, cut in the turf, and was locally known as the
"Mize-maze." It became very indistinct about 1858, and was then recut
by the Warden of Winchester, with the aid of a plan possessed by a
lady living in the neighbourhood.</p>

</div>

<p>A maze formerly existed on Ripon Common, in Yorkshire (Fig. 10). It
was ploughed up in 1827, but its plan was fortunately preserved. This
example was 20 yards in diameter, and its path is said to have been
407 yards long.</p>

<p>In the case of the maze at Theobalds, Hertfordshire, after you have
found the entrance within the four enclosing hedges, the path is
<span class='pagenum'>Pg 131<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>forced (Fig. 11). As further illustrations of this class of maze, I
give one taken from an Italian work on architecture by Serlio,
published in 1537 (Fig. 12), and one by London and Wise, the designers
of the Hampton Court maze, from their book, <i>The Retired Gard'ner</i>,
published in 1706 (Fig. 13). Also, I add a Dutch maze (Fig. 14).</p>

<p>So far our mazes have been of historical interest, but they have
presented no difficulty in threading. After the Reformation period we
find mazes converted into mediums for recreation, and they generally
consisted of labyrinthine paths enclosed by thick and carefully
trimmed hedges. These topiary hedges were known to the Romans, with
whom the <i>topiarius</i> was the ornamental gardener. This type of maze
has of late years degenerated into the seaside "Puzzle Gardens. Teas,
sixpence, including admission to the Maze." The Hampton Court Maze,
sometimes called the "Wilderness," at the royal palace, was designed,
as I have said, by London and Wise for William III., who had a liking
for such things (Fig. 15). I have before me some three or four
versions of it, all slightly different from one another; but the plan
I select is taken from an old guide-book to the palace, and therefore
ought to be trustworthy. The meaning of the dotted lines, etc., will
be explained later on.</p>

</div>

<p>The maze at Hatfield House (Fig. 16), the seat of the Marquis of
Salisbury, like so many labyrinths, is not difficult on paper; but
both <span class='pagenum'>Pg 132<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>this and the Hampton Court Maze may prove very puzzling to
actually thread without knowing the plan. One reason is that one is so
apt to go down the same blind alleys over and over again, if one
proceeds without method. The maze planned by the desire of the Prince
Consort for the Royal Horticultural Society's Gardens at South
Kensington was allowed to go to ruin, and was then destroyed&mdash;no great
loss, for it was a feeble thing. It will be seen that there were three
entrances from the outside (Fig. 17), but the way to the centre is
very easy to discover. I include a German maze that is curious, but
not difficult to thread on paper (Fig. 18). The example of a labyrinth
formerly existing at Pimperne, in Dorset, is in a class by itself
(Fig. 19). It was formed of small ridges about a foot high, and
covered nearly an <span class='pagenum'>Pg 133<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>acre of ground; but it was, unfortunately, ploughed
up in 1730.</p>

<p>We will now pass to the interesting subject of how to thread any maze.
While being necessarily brief, I will try to make the matter clear to
readers who have no knowledge of mathematics. And first of all we will
assume that we are trying to enter a maze (that is, get to the
"centre") of which we have no plan and about which we know nothing.
The first rule is this: If a maze has no parts of its hedges detached
from the rest, then if we always keep in touch with the hedge with the
right hand (or always touch it with the left), going down to the stop
in every blind alley and coming back on the other side, we shall pass
through every part of the maze and make our exit where we went in.
Therefore we must at one time or another enter the centre, and every
alley will be traversed twice.</p>

<p>Now look at the Hampton Court plan. Follow, say to the right, the path
indicated by the <span class='pagenum'>Pg 134<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>dotted line, and what I have said is clearly correct
if we obliterate the two detached parts, or "islands," situated on
each side of the star. But as these islands are there, you cannot by
this method traverse every part of the maze; and if it had been so
planned that the "centre" was, like the star, between the two islands,
you would never pass through the "centre" at all. A glance at the
Hatfield maze will show that there are three of these detached hedges
or islands at the centre, so this method will never take you to the
"centre" of that one. But the rule will at least always bring you
safely out again unless you blunder in the following way. Suppose,
when you were going in the direction of the arrow in the Hampton Court
Maze, that you could not distinctly see the turning at the bottom,
that you imagined you were in a blind alley and, to save time, crossed
at once to the opposite hedge, then you would go round and round that
U-shaped island with your right hand still always on the hedge&mdash;for
ever after!</p>

<p>This blunder happened to me a few years ago in a little maze on the
isle of Caldy, South Wales. I knew the maze was a small one, but after
a very long walk I was amazed to find that I did not either reach the
"centre" or get out again. So I threw a piece of paper on the ground,
and soon came round to it; from which I knew that I had blundered over
a supposed blind alley and was going round and round an island.
Crossing to the opposite hedge and using more care, I was quickly at
the centre and out again. Now, if I had made a similar mistake at
Hampton Court, and discovered the error when at the star, I should
merely have passed from one island to another! And if I had again
discovered that I was on a detached part, I might with ill luck have
recrossed to the first island again! We thus see that this "touching
the hedge" method should always bring us safely out of a maze that we
have entered; it may happen to take us through the "centre," and if we
miss the centre we shall know there must be islands. But it has to be
<span class='pagenum'>Pg 135<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>done with a little care, and in no case can we be sure that we have
traversed every alley or that there are no detached parts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/mzfig20.png" width="400" height="374" alt="FIG. 20.&mdash;M. Tremaux&#39;s Method of Solution." title="" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 20.&mdash;M. Tremaux&#39;s Method of Solution.</span>
</div>

<p>If the maze has many islands, the traversing of the whole of it may be
a matter of considerable difficulty. Here is a method for solving any
maze, due to M. Tr&eacute;maux, but it necessitates carefully marking in some
way your entrances and exits where the galleries fork. I give a
diagram of an imaginary maze of a very simple character that will
serve our purpose just as well as something more complex (Fig. 20).
The circles at the regions where we have a choice of turnings we may
call nodes. A "new" path or node is one that has not been entered
before on the route; an "old" path or node is one that has already
been entered, 1. No path may be traversed more than twice. 2. When you
come to a new node, take any path you like. 3. When by a new path you
come to an old node or to the stop of a blind alley, return by the
path you came. 4. When by an old path you come to an old node, take a
new path if there is one; if not, an old path. The route indicated by
the dotted line in the diagram is taken in accordance with these
simple rules, and it will be seen that it leads us to the centre,
although the maze consists of four islands.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/mzfig21.png" width="600" height="367" alt="FIG. 21.&mdash;How to thread the Hatfield Maze." title="" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 21.&mdash;How to thread the Hatfield Maze.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 136<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>Neither of the methods I have given will disclose to us the shortest
way to the centre, nor the number of the different routes. But we can
easily settle these points with a plan. Let us take the Hatfield maze
(Fig. 21). It will be seen that I have suppressed all the blind alleys
by the shading. I begin at the stop and work backwards until the path
forks. These shaded parts, therefore, can never be entered without our
having to retrace our steps. Then it is very clearly seen that if we
enter at A we must come out at B; if we enter at C we must come out at
D. Then we have merely to determine whether A, B, E, or C, D, E, is
the shorter route. As a matter of fact, it will be found by rough
measurement or calculation that the shortest route to the centre is by
way of C, D, E, F.</p>

<p>I will now give three mazes that are simply puzzles on paper, for, so
far as I know, they have never been constructed in any other way. The
first I will call the Philadelphia maze (Fig. 22). Fourteen years ago
a travelling salesman, <span class='pagenum'>Pg 137<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>living in Philadelphia, U.S.A., developed a
curiously unrestrained passion for puzzles. He neglected his business,
and soon his position was taken from him. His days and nights were now
passed with the subject that fascinated him, and this little maze
seems to have driven him into insanity. He had been puzzling over it
for some time, and finally it sent him mad and caused him to fire a
bullet through his brain. Goodness knows what his difficulties could
have been! But there can be little doubt that he had a disordered
mind, and that if this little puzzle had not caused him to lose his
mental balance some other more or less trivial thing would in time
have done so. There is no moral in the story, unless it be that of the
Irish maxim, which applies to every occupation of life as much as to
the solving of puzzles: "Take things aisy; if you can't take them
aisy, take them as aisy as you can." And it is a bad and empirical way
of solving any puzzle&mdash;by blowing your brains out.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 22. The Philadelphia Maze, and its Solution.</span>
</div>

<p>Now, how many different routes are there from A to B in this maze if
we must never in any route go along the same passage twice? The four
open spaces where four passages end are not reckoned as "passages." In
the diagram (Fig. 22) it will be seen that I have again suppressed the
blind alleys. It will be found that, in any case, we must go from A to
C, and also from F to B. But when we have arrived at C there are three
ways, marked 1, 2, 3, of getting to D. Similarly, when we get to E
there are three ways, marked 4, 5, 6, of getting to F. We have also
the dotted route from C to E, the other dotted route from D to F, and
the passage from D to E, indicated by stars. We can, therefore,
express the position of affairs by the little diagram annexed (Fig.
23). Here every condition of route exactly corresponds to that in the
circular maze, only it is much less confusing to the eye. Now, the
number of routes, under the conditions, from A to B on this simplified
diagram is 640, and that is the required answer to the maze puzzle.</p>

<p>Finally, I will leave two easy maze puzzles (Figs. 24, 25) for my
readers to solve for themselves. The puzzle in each case is to find
the shortest possible route to the centre. Everybody knows the story
of Fair Rosamund and the Woodstock maze. What the maze was like or
whether it ever existed except in imagination is not known, many
writers believing that it was simply a badly-constructed house with a
large number of confusing rooms and passages. At any rate, my sketch
lacks the authority of the other mazes in this article. My "Rosamund's
Bower" is simply designed to show that where you have the plan before
you it often happens that the easiest way to find a route into a maze
is by working backwards and first finding a way out.</p>

"Is not life itself a paradox?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">C.L. DODGSON, <i>Pillow Problems</i>.</span><br />
</p>


<p>"It is a wonderful age!" said Mr. Allgood, and everybody at the table
turned towards him and assumed an attitude of expectancy.</p>

<p>This was an ordinary Christmas dinner of the Allgood family, with a
sprinkling of local friends. Nobody would have supposed that the above
remark would lead, as it did, to a succession of curious puzzles and
paradoxes, to which every member of the party contributed something of
interest. The little symposium was quite unpremeditated, so we must
not be too critical respecting a few of the posers that were
forthcoming. The varied character of the contributions is just what we
would expect on such an occasion, for it was a gathering not of expert
mathematicians and logicians, but of quite ordinary folk.</p>

<p>"It is a wonderful age!" repeated Mr. Allgood. "A man has just
designed a square house in such a cunning manner that all the windows
on the four sides have a south aspect."</p>

<p>"That would appeal to me," said Mrs. Allgood, "for I cannot endure a
room with a north aspect."</p>

<p>"I cannot conceive how it is done," Uncle John confessed. "I suppose
he puts bay windows on the east and west sides; but how on earth can
be contrive to look south from the north side? Does he use mirrors, or
something of that kind?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Mr. Allgood, "nothing of the sort. All the windows are
flush with the walls, and yet you get a southerly prospect from every
one of them. You see, there is no real difficulty in designing the
house if you select the proper spot for its erection. Now, this house
is designed for a gentleman who proposes to build it exactly at the
North Pole. If you think a moment you will realize that when you stand
at the North Pole it is impossible, no matter which way you may turn,
to look elsewhere than due south! There are no such directions as
north, east, or west when you are exactly at the North Pole.
Everything is due south!"</p>

<p>"I am afraid, mother," said her son George, after the laughter had
subsided, "that, however much you might like the aspect, the situation
would be a little too bracing for you."</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" she replied. "Your Uncle John fell also into the trap. I
am no good at catches and puzzles. I suppose I haven't the right sort
of brain. Perhaps some one will explain this to me. Only last week I
remarked to my hairdresser that it had been said that there are more
persons in the world than any one of them has hairs on his head. He
replied, 'Then it follows, madam, that two persons, at least, must
have exactly the same number of <span class='pagenum'>Pg 138<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>hairs on their heads.' If this is a
fact, I confess I cannot see it."</p>

<p>"How do the bald-headed affect the question?" asked Uncle John.</p>

<p>"If there are such persons in existence," replied Mrs. Allgood, "who
haven't a solitary hair on their heads discoverable under a
magnifying-glass, we will leave them out of the question. Still, I
don't see how you are to prove that at least two persons have exactly
the same number to a hair."</p>

<p>"I think I can make it clear," said Mr. Filkins, who had dropped in
for the evening. "Assume the population of the world to be only one
million. Any number will do as well as another. Then your statement
was to the effect that no person has more than nine hundred and
ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine hairs on his head.
Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Let me think," said Mrs. Allgood. "Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;that is correct."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. As there are only nine hundred and ninety-nine
thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine <i>different</i> ways of bearing
hair, it is clear that the millionth person must repeat one of those
ways. Do you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I see that&mdash;at least I think I see it."</p>

<p>"Therefore two persons at least must have the same number of hairs on
their heads; and as the number of people on the earth so greatly
exceeds the number of hairs on any one person's head, there must, of
course, be an immense number of these repetitions."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Filkins," said little Willie Allgood, "why could not the
millionth man have, say, ten thousand hairs and a half?"</p>

<p>"That is mere hair-splitting, Willie, and does not come into the
question."</p>

<p>"Here is a curious paradox," said George. "If a thousand soldiers are
drawn up in battle array on a plane"&mdash;they understood him to mean
"plain"&mdash;"only one man will stand upright."</p>

<p>Nobody could see why. But George explained that, according to Euclid,
a plane can touch a sphere only at one point, and that person only who
stands at that point, with respect to the centre of the earth, will
stand upright.</p>

<p>"In the same way," he remarked, "if a billiard-table were quite
level&mdash;that is, a perfect plane&mdash;the balls ought to roll to the
centre."</p>

<p>Though he tried to explain this by placing a visiting-card on an
orange and expounding the law of gravitation, Mrs. Allgood declined to
accept the statement. She could not see that the top of a true
billiard-table must, theoretically, be spherical, just like a portion
of the orange-peel that George cut out. Of course, the table is so
small in proportion to the surface of the earth that the curvature is
not appreciable, but it is nevertheless true in theory. A surface that
we call level is not the same as our idea of a true geometrical plane.</p>

<p>"Uncle John," broke in Willie Allgood, "there is a certain island
situated between England and France, and yet that island is farther
from France than England is. What is the island?"</p>

<p>"That seems absurd, my boy; because if I place this tumbler, to
represent the island, between these two plates, it seems impossible
that the tumbler can be farther from either of the plates than they
are from each other."</p>

<p>"But isn't Guernsey between England and France?" asked Willie.</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I think you will find, uncle, that Guernsey is about
twenty-six miles from France, and England is only twenty-one miles
from France, between Calais and Dover."</p>

<p>"My mathematical master," said George, "has been trying to induce me
to accept the axiom that 'if equals be multiplied by equals the
products are equal.'"</p>

<p>"It is self-evident," pointed out Mr. Filkins. "For example, if 3 feet
equal 1 yard, then twice 3 feet will equal 2 yards. Do you see?"</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Filkins," asked George, "is this tumbler half full of water
equal to a similar glass half empty?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, George."</p>

<p>"Then it follows from the axiom that a glass full must equal a glass
empty. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>"No, clearly not. I never thought of it in that light."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested Mr. Allgood, "the rule does not apply to
liquids."</p>

<p>"Just what I was thinking, Allgood. It would seem that we must make an
exception in the case of liquids."</p>

<p>"But it would be awkward," said George, with a smile, "if we also had
to except the case of solids. For instance, let us take the solid
earth. One mile square equals one square mile. Therefore two miles
square must equal two square miles. Is this so?"</p>

<p>"Well, let me see! No, of course not," Mr. Filkins replied, "because
two miles square is four square miles."</p>

<p>"Then," said George, "if the axiom is not true in these cases, when is
it true?"</p>

<p>Mr. Filkins promised to look into the matter, and perhaps the reader
will also like to give it consideration at leisure.</p>

<p>"Look here, George," said his cousin Reginald Woolley: "by what
fractional part does four-fourths exceed three-fourths?"</p>

<p>"By one-fourth!" shouted everybody at once.</p>

<p>"Try another one," George suggested.</p>

<p>"With pleasure, when you have answered that one correctly," was
Reginald's reply.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that it isn't one-fourth?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I do."</p>

<p>Several members of the company failed to see that the correct answer
is "one-third," although Reginald tried to explain that three of
anything, if increased by one-third, becomes four.</p>

<p>"Uncle John, how do you pronounce 't-o-o'?" asked Willie.</p>

<p>"'Too," my boy."</p>

<p>"And how do you pronounce 't-w-o'?"</p>

<p>"That is also 'too.'"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 139<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>"Then how do you pronounce the second day of the week?"</p>

<p>"Well, that I should pronounce 'Tuesday,' not 'Toosday.'"</p>

<p>"Would you really? I should pronounce it 'Monday.'"</p>

<p>"If you go on like this, Willie," said Uncle John, with mock severity,
"you will soon be without a friend in the world."</p>

<p>"Can any of you write down quickly in figures 'twelve thousand twelve
hundred and twelve pounds'?" asked Mr. Allgood.</p>

<p>His eldest daughter, Miss Mildred, was the only person who happened to
have a pencil at hand.</p>

<p>"It can't be done," she declared, after making an attempt on the white
table-cloth; but Mr. Allgood showed her that it should be written,
"&pound;13,212."</p>

<p>"Now it is my turn," said Mildred. "I have been waiting to ask you all
a question. In the Massacre of the Innocents under Herod, a number of
poor little children were buried in the sand with only their feet
sticking out. How might you distinguish the boys from the girls?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Mrs. Allgood, "it is a conundrum&mdash;something to do
with their poor little 'souls.'"</p>

<p>But after everybody had given it up, Mildred reminded the company that
only boys were put to death.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," began George, "Achilles had a race with a
tortoise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, George!" interposed Mr. Allgood. "We won't have that one. I
knew two men in my youth who were once the best of friends, but they
quarrelled over that infernal thing of Zeno's, and they never spoke to
one another again for the rest of their lives. I draw the line at
that, and the other stupid thing by Zeno about the flying arrow. I
don't believe anybody understands them, because I could never do so
myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, then, father. Here is another. The Post-Office people
were about to erect a line of telegraph-posts over a high hill from
Turmitville to Wurzleton; but as it was found that a railway company
was making a deep level cutting in the same direction, they arranged
to put up the posts beside the line. Now, the posts were to be a
hundred yards apart, the length of the road over the hill being five
miles, and the length of the level cutting only four and a half miles.
How many posts did they save by erecting them on the level?"</p>

<p>"That is a very simple matter of calculation," said Mr. Filkins.
"Find how many times one hundred yards will go in five miles, and how
many times in four and a half miles. Then deduct one from the other,
and you have the number of posts saved by the shorter route."</p>

<p>"Quite right," confirmed Mr. Allgood. "Nothing could be easier."</p>

<p>"That is just what the Post-Office people said," replied George, "but
it is quite wrong. If you look at this sketch that I have just made,
you will see that there is no difference whatever. If the posts are a
hundred yards apart, just the same number will be required on the
level as over the surface of the hill."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/pdoxprty.png" width="400" height="106" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Surely you must be wrong, George," said Mrs. Allgood, "for if the
posts are a hundred yards apart and it is half a mile farther over the
hill, you have to put up posts on that extra half-mile."</p>

<p>"Look at the diagram, mother. You will see that the distance from post
to post is not the distance from base to base measured along the
ground. I am just the same distance from you if I stand on this spot
on the carpet or stand immediately above it on the chair."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Allgood was not convinced.</p>

<p>Mr. Smoothly, the curate, at the end of the table, said at this point
that he had a little question to ask.</p>

<p>"Suppose the earth were a perfect sphere with a smooth surface, and a
girdle of steel were placed round the Equator so that it touched at
every point."</p>

<p>"'I'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes,'" muttered
George, quoting the words of Puck in <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>.</p>

<p>"Now, if six yards were added to the length of the girdle, what would
then be the distance between the girdle and the earth, supposing that
distance to be equal all round?"</p>

<p>"In such a great length," said Mr. Allgood, "I do not suppose the
distance would be worth mentioning."</p>

<p>"What do you say, George?" asked Mr. Smoothly.</p>

<p>"Well, without calculating I should imagine it would be a very minute
fraction of an inch."</p>

<p>Reginald and Mr. Filkins were of the same opinion.</p>

<p>"I think it will surprise you all," said the curate, "to learn that
those extra six yards would make the distance from the earth all round
the girdle very nearly a yard!"</p>

<p>"Very nearly a yard!" everybody exclaimed, with astonishment; but Mr.
Smoothly was quite correct. The increase is independent of the
original length of the girdle, which may be round the earth or round
an orange; in any case the additional six yards will give a distance
of nearly a yard all round. This is apt to surprise the
non-mathematical mind.</p>

<p>"Did you hear the story of the extraordinary precocity of Mrs.
Perkins's baby that died last week?" asked Mrs. Allgood. "It was only
three months old, and lying at the point of death, when the
grief-stricken mother asked the doctor if nothing could save it.
'Absolutely nothing!' said the doctor. Then the infant looked up
pitifully into its mother's face and said&mdash;absolutely nothing!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" insisted Mildred. "And only three months old!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 140<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>"There have been extraordinary cases of infantile precocity," said
Mr. Filkins, "the truth of which has often been carefully attested.
But are you sure this really happened, Mrs. Allgood?"</p>

<p>"Positive," replied the lady. "But do you really think it astonishing
that a child of three months should say absolutely nothing? What would
you expect it to say?"</p>

<p>"Speaking of death," said Mr. Smoothly, solemnly, "I knew two men,
father and son, who died in the same battle during the South African
War. They were both named Andrew Johnson and buried side by side, but
there was some difficulty in distinguishing them on the headstones.
What would you have done?"</p>

<p>"Quite simple," said Mr. Allgood. "They should have described one as
'Andrew Johnson, Senior,' and the other as 'Andrew Johnson, Junior.'"</p>

<p>"But I forgot to tell you that the father died first."</p>

<p>"What difference can that make?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, they wanted to be absolutely exact, and that was the
difficulty."</p>

<p>"But I don't see any difficulty," said Mr. Allgood, nor could anybody
else.</p>

<p>"Well," explained Mr. Smoothly, "it is like this. If the father died
first, the son was then no longer 'Junior.' Is that so?"</p>

<p>"To be strictly exact, yes."</p>

<p>"That is just what they wanted&mdash;to be strictly exact. Now, if he was
no longer 'Junior,' then he did not die 'Junior." Consequently it must
be incorrect so to describe him on the headstone. Do you see the
point?"</p>

<p>"Here is a rather curious thing," said Mr. Filkins, "that I have just
remembered. A man wrote to me the other day that he had recently
discovered two old coins while digging in his garden. One was dated
'51 B.C.,' and the other one marked 'George I.' How do I know that he
was not writing the truth?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you know the man to be addicted to lying," said Reginald.</p>

<p>"But that would be no proof that he was not telling the truth in this
instance."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested Mildred, "you know that there were no coins made
at those dates.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, they were made at both periods."</p>

<p>"Were they silver or copper coins?" asked Willie.</p>

<p>"My friend did not state, and I really cannot see, Willie, that it
makes any difference."</p>

<p>"I see it!" shouted Reginald. "The letters 'B.C.' would never be used
on a coin made before the birth of Christ. They never anticipated the
event in that way. The letters were only adopted later to denote dates
previous to those which we call 'A.D.' That is very good; but I cannot
see why the other statement could not be correct."</p>

<p>"Reginald is quite right," said Mr. Filkins, "about the first coin.
The second one could not exist, because the first George would never
be described in his lifetime as 'George I.'"</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Mrs. Allgood. "He <i>was</i> George I."</p>

<p>"Yes; but they would not know it until there was a George II."</p>

<p>"Then there was no George II. until George III. came to the throne?"</p>

<p>"That does not follow. The second George becomes 'George II.' on
account of there having been a 'George I.'"</p>

<p>"Then the first George was 'George I.' on account of there having been
no king of that name before him."</p>

<p>"Don't you see, mother," said George Allgood, "we did not call Queen
Victoria 'Victoria I.;' but if there is ever a 'Victoria II.,' then
she will be known that way."</p>

<p>"But there <i>have</i> been several Georges, and therefore he was 'George
I.' There <i>haven't</i> been several Victorias, so the two cases are not
similar."</p>

<p>They gave up the attempt to convince Mrs. Allgood, but the reader
will, of course, see the point clearly.</p>

<p>"Here is a question," said Mildred Allgood, "that I should like some
of you to settle for me. I am accustomed to buy from our greengrocer
bundles of asparagus, each 12 inches in circumference. I always put a
tape measure round them to make sure I am getting the full quantity.
The other day the man had no large bundles in stock, but handed me
instead two small ones, each 6 inches in circumference. 'That is the
same thing,' I said, 'and, of course, the price will be the same;' but
he insisted that the two bundles together contained more than the
large one, and charged me a few pence extra. Now, what I want to know
is, which of us was correct? Would the two small bundles contain the
same quantity as the large one? Or would they contain more?"</p>

<p>"That is the ancient puzzle," said Reginald, laughing, "of the sack of
corn that Sempronius borrowed from Caius, which your greengrocer,
perhaps, had been reading about somewhere. He caught you beautifully."</p>

<p>"Then they were equal?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, you were both wrong, and you were badly cheated. You
only got half the quantity that would have been contained in a large
bundle, and therefore ought to have been charged half the original
price, instead of more."</p>

<p>Yes, it was a bad swindle, undoubtedly. A circle with a circumference
half that of another must have its area a quarter that of the other.
Therefore the two small bundles contained together only half as much
asparagus as a large one.</p>

<p>"Mr. Filkins, can you answer this?" asked Willie. "There is a man in
the next village who eats two eggs for breakfast every morning."</p>

<p>"Nothing very extraordinary in that," George broke in. "If you told us
that the two eggs ate the man it would be interesting."</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt the boy, George," said his mother.</p>

<p>"Well," Willie continued, "this man neither buys, borrows, barters,
begs, steals, nor finds the eggs. He doesn't keep hens, and the eggs
<span class='pagenum'>Pg 141<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>are not given to him. How does he get the eggs?"</p>

<p>"Does he take them in exchange for something else?" asked Mildred.</p>

<p>"That would be bartering them," Willie replied.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some friend sends them to him," suggested Mrs. Allgood.</p>

<p>"I said that they were not given to him."</p>

<p>"I know," said George, with confidence. "A strange hen comes into his
place and lays them."</p>

<p>"But that would be finding them, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Does he hire them?" asked Reginald.</p>

<p>"If so, he could not return them after they were eaten, so that would
be stealing them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is a pun on the word 'lay,'" Mr. Filkins said. "Does he
lay them on the table?"</p>

<p>"He would have to get them first, wouldn't he? The question was, How
does he get them?"</p>

<p>"Give it up!" said everybody. Then little Willie crept round to the
protection of his mother, for George was apt to be rough on such
occasions.</p>

<p>"The man keeps ducks!" he cried, "and his servant collects the eggs
every morning."</p>

<p>"But you said he doesn't keep birds!" George protested.</p>

<p>"I didn't, did I, Mr. Filkins? I said he doesn't keep hens."</p>

<p>"But he finds them," said Reginald.</p>

<p>"No; I said his servant finds them."</p>

<p>"Well, then," Mildred interposed, "his servant gives them to him."</p>

<p>"You cannot give a man his own property, can you?"</p>

<p>All agreed that Willie's answer was quite satisfactory. Then Uncle
John produced a little fallacy that "brought the proceedings to a
close," as the newspapers say.</p>

<p>"Here is a diagram of a chessboard," he said. "You see there are
sixty-four squares&mdash;eight by eight. Now I draw a straight line from
the top left-hand corner, where the first and second squares meet, to
the bottom right-hand corner. I cut along this line with the scissors,
slide up the piece that I have marked B, and then clip off the little
corner C by a cut along the first upright line. This little piece will
exactly fit into its place at the top, and we now have an oblong with
seven squares on one side and nine squares on the other. There are,
therefore, now only sixty-three squares, because seven multiplied by
nine makes sixty-three. Where on earth does that lost square go to? I
have tried over and over again to catch the little beggar, but he
always eludes me. For the life of me I cannot discover where he hides
himself."</p>

<p>"It seems to be like the other old chessboard fallacy, and perhaps the
explanation is the same," said Reginald&mdash;"that the pieces do not
exactly fit."</p>

<p>"But they <i>do</i> fit," said Uncle John. "Try it, and you will see."</p>

<p>Later in the evening Reginald and George, were seen in a corner with
their heads together, trying to catch that elusive little square, and
it is only fair to record that before they retired for the night they
succeeded in securing their prey, though some others of the company
failed to see it when captured. Can the reader solve the little
mystery?</p>

<p>Anderson, Biggs, and Carpenter were staying together at a place by the
seaside. One day they went out in a boat and were a mile at sea when a
rifle was fired on shore in their direction. Why or by whom the shot
was fired fortunately does not concern us, as no information on these

material for a curious little puzzle for the novice.</p>

<p>The illustration represents one of the most ancient of all mechanical
puzzles. Its origin is unknown. Cardan, the mathematician, wrote about
it in 1550, and Wallis in 1693; while it is said still to be found in
obscure English villages (sometimes deposited in strange places, such
as a church belfry), made of iron, and appropriately called
"tiring-irons," and to be used by the Norwegians to-day as a lock for
boxes and bags. In the toyshops it is sometimes called the "Chinese
rings," though there seems to be no authority for the description, and
it more frequently goes by the unsatisfactory name of "the puzzling
rings." The French call it "Baguenaudier."</p>

<p>The puzzle will be seen to consist of a simple <i>loop</i> of wire fixed in
a handle to be held in the left hand, and a certain number of <i>rings</i>
secured by <i>wires</i> which pass through holes in the <i>bar</i> and are kept
there by their blunted ends. The wires work freely in the bar, but
cannot come apart from it, nor can the wires be removed from the
rings. The general puzzle is to detach the loop completely from all
the rings, and then to put them all on again.</p>

<p>Now, it will be seen at a glance that the first ring (to the right)
can be taken off at any time by sliding it over the end and dropping
it through the loop; or it may be put on by reversing the operation.
With this exception, the only ring that can ever be removed is the one
that happens to be a contiguous second on the loop at the right-hand
end. Thus, with all the rings on, the second can be dropped at once;
with the first ring down, you cannot drop the second, but may remove
the third; with the first three rings down, you cannot drop the
fourth, but may remove the fifth; and so on. It will be found that the
first and second rings can be dropped together or put on together; but
to prevent confusion we will throughout disallow this exceptional
double move, and say that only one ring may be put on or removed at a
time.</p>

<p>We can thus take off one ring in 1 move; two rings in 2 moves; three
rings in 5 moves; four rings in 10 moves; five rings in 21 moves; and
if we keep on doubling (and adding one where the number of rings is
odd) we may easily ascertain the number of moves for completely
removing any number of rings. To get off all the seven rings requires
85 moves. Let us look at the five moves made in removing the first
three rings, the circles above the line standing for rings on the loop
and those under for rings off the loop.</p>

<p>Drop the first ring; drop the third; put up the first; drop the
second; and drop the first&mdash;5 moves, as shown clearly in the diagrams.
The dark circles show at each stage, from the starting position to the
finish, which rings it is possible to drop. After move 2 it will be
noticed that no ring can be dropped until one has been put on, because
the first and second rings from the right now on the loop are not
together. After the fifth move, if we wish to remove all seven <span class='pagenum'>Pg 143<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>rings
we must now drop the fifth. But before we can then remove the fourth
it is necessary to put on the first three and remove the first two. We
shall then have 7, 6, 4, 3 on the loop, and may therefore drop the
fourth. When we have put on 2 and 1 and removed 3, 2, 1, we may drop
the seventh ring. The next operation then will be to get 6, 5, 4, 3,
2, 1 on the loop and remove 4, 3, 2, 1, when 6 will come off; then get
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 on the loop, and remove 3, 2, 1, when 5 will come off;
then get 4, 3, 2, 1 on the loop and remove 2, 1, when 4 will come off;
then get 3, 2, 1 on the loop and remove 1, when 3 will come off; then
get 2, 1 on the loop, when 2 will come off; and 1 will fall through on
the 85th move, leaving the loop quite free. The reader should now be
able to understand the puzzle, whether or not he has it in his hand in
a practical form.</p>

<p>The particular problem I propose is simply this. Suppose there are
altogether fourteen rings on the tiring-irons, and we proceed to take
them all off in the correct way so as not to waste any moves. What
will be the position of the rings after the 9,999th move has been
made?</p>

<p>In a suburban villa there is a small staircase with eight steps, not
counting the landing. The little puzzle with which Tommy Smart
perplexed his family is this. You are required to start from the
bottom and land twice on the floor above (stopping there at the
finish), having returned once to the ground floor. But you must be
careful to use every tread the same number of times. In how few steps
can you make the ascent? It seems a very simple matter, but it is more
than likely that at your first attempt you will make a great many more
steps than are necessary. Of course you must not go more than one
riser at a time.</p>

<p>Tommy knows the trick, and has shown it to his father, who professes
to have a contempt for such things; but when the children are in bed
the pater will often take friends out into the hall and enjoy a good
laugh at their bewilderment. And yet it is all so very simple when you
know how it is done.</p>

<p>Here is a really hard puzzle, and yet its conditions are so absurdly
simple. Every reader knows how to place four pennies so that they are
equidistant from each other. All you have to do is to arrange three of
them flat on the table so that they touch one another in the form of a
triangle, and lay the fourth penny on top in the centre. Then, as
every penny touches every other penny, they are all at equal distances
from one another. Now try to do the same thing with five
pennies&mdash;place them so that every penny shall touch every other
penny&mdash;and you will find it a different matter altogether.</p>

<p>The annals of Scotland Yard contain some remarkable cases of jewel
robberies, but one of the most perplexing was the theft of Lady
Littlewood's rubies. There have, of course, been many greater
robberies in point of value, but few so artfully conceived. Lady
Littlewood, of Romley Manor, had a beautiful but rather eccentric
heirloom in the form of a ruby brooch. While staying at her town house
early in the eighties she took the jewel to a shop in Brompton for
some slight repairs.</p>

<p>"A fine collection of rubies, madam," said the shopkeeper, to whom her
ladyship was a stranger.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied; "but curiously enough I have never actually
counted them. My mother once pointed out to me that if you start from
the centre and count up one line, along the outside and down the next
line, there are always eight rubies. So I should always know if a
stone were missing."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/q423.png" width="400" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Six months later a brother of Lady Little<span class='pagenum'>Pg 145<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>wood's, who had returned
from his regiment in India, noticed that his sister was wearing the
ruby brooch one night at a county ball, and on their return home asked
to look at it more closely. He immediately detected the fact that four
of the stones were gone.</p>

<p>"How can that possibly be?" said Lady Littlewood. "If you count up one
line from the centre, along the edge, and down the next line, in any
direction, there are always eight stones. This was always so and is so
now. How, therefore, would it be possible to remove a stone without my
detecting it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing could be simpler," replied the brother. "I know the brooch
well. It originally contained forty-five stones, and there are now
only forty-one. Somebody has stolen four rubies, and then reset as
small a number of the others as possible in such a way that there
shall always be eight in any of the directions you have mentioned."</p>

<p>There was not the slightest doubt that the Brompton jeweller was the
thief, and the matter was placed in the hands of the police. But the
man was wanted for other robberies, and had left the neighbourhood
some time before. To this day he has never been found.</p>

<p>The interesting little point that at first baffled the police, and
which forms the subject of our puzzle, is this: How were the
forty-five rubies originally arranged on the brooch? The illustration
shows exactly how the forty-one were arranged after it came back from
the jeweller; but although they count eight correctly in any of the
directions mentioned, there are four stones missing.</p>

those shown. How were the pieces put together? When I published this
little puzzle in a London newspaper I received (though they were
unsolicited) quite a stack of models, in oak, in teak, in mahogany,
rosewood, satinwood, elm, and deal; some half a foot in length, and
others varying in size right down to a delicate little model about
half an inch square. It seemed to create considerable interest.</p>

<p>The worthy vicar of Chumpley St. Winifred is in great distress. A
little church difficulty has arisen that all the combined intelligence
of the parish seems unable to surmount. What this difficulty is I will
state hereafter, but it may add to the interest of the problem if I
first give a short account of the curious position that has been
brought about. It all has to do with the church hymn-boards, the
plates of which have become so damaged that they have ceased to fulfil
the purpose for which they were devised. A generous parishioner has
promised to pay for a new set of plates at a certain rate of cost; but
strange as it may seem, no agreement can be come to as to what that
cost should be. The proposed maker of the plates has named <span class='pagenum'>Pg 146<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span>a price
which the donor declares to be absurd. The good vicar thinks they are
both wrong, so he asks the schoolmaster to work out the little sum.
But this individual declares that he can find no rule bearing on the
subject in any of his arithmetic books. An application having been
made to the local medical practitioner, as a man of more than average
intellect at Chumpley, he has assured the vicar that his practice is
so heavy that he has not had time even to look at it, though his
assistant whispers that the doctor has been sitting up unusually late
for several nights past. Widow Wilson has a smart son, who is reputed
to have once won a prize for puzzle-solving. He asserts that as he
cannot find any solution to the problem it must have something to do
with the squaring of the circle, the duplication of the cube, or the
trisection of an angle; at any rate, he has never before seen a puzzle
on the principle, and he gives it up.</p>

<p>This was the state of affairs when the assistant curate (who, I should
say, had frankly confessed from the first that a profound study of
theology had knocked out of his head all the knowledge of mathematics
he ever possessed) kindly sent me the puzzle.</p>

<p>A church has three hymn-boards, each to indicate the numbers of five
different hymns to be sung at a service. All the boards are in use at
the same service. The hymn-book contains 700 hymns. A new set of
numbers is required, and a kind parishioner offers to present a set
painted on metal plates, but stipulates that only the smallest number
of plates necessary shall be purchased. The cost of each plate is to
be 6<i>d</i>., and for the painting of each plate the charges are to be: For
one plate, 1<i>s</i>.; for two plates alike, 11¾<i>d</i>. each; for three plates
alike, 11½<i>d</i>. each, and so on, the charge being one farthing less
per plate for each similarly painted plate. Now, what should be the
lowest cost?</p>

<p>Readers will note that they are required to use every legitimate and
practical method of economy. The illustration will make clear the
nature of the three hymn-boards and plates. The five hymns are here
indicated by means of twelve plates. These plates slide in separately
at the back, and in the illustration there is room, of course, for
three more plates.</p>

<p>A Cockney friend, who is very apt to draw the long bow, and is

the following not very credible yarn:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've just been pheasant-shooting with my friend the duke. We had
splendid sport, and I made some wonderful shots. What do you think of
this, for instance? Perhaps you can twist it into a puzzle. The duke
and I were crossing a field when suddenly twenty-four pheasants rose
on the wing right in front of us. I fired, and two-thirds of them
dropped dead at my feet. Then the duke had a shot at what were left,
and brought down three-twenty-fourths of them, wounded in the wing.
Now, out of those twenty-four birds, how many still remained?"</p>

should give a special catch puzzle in the issue of <i>The Weekly
Dispatch</i> for All Fools' Day, 1900. So I gave the following, and it

it ran for nearly a month.</p>

to witness one All Fools' Day has fixed itself indelibly on my memory.
It happened at a country-house, where the gardener and the cook
decided to run a race to a point 100 feet straight away and return. I
found that the gardener ran 3 feet at every bound and the cook only 2
feet, but then she made three bounds to his two. Now, what was the
result of the race?"</p>

<p>A fortnight after publication I added the following note: "It has been
suggested that perhaps there is a catch in the 'return,' but there is
not. The race is to a point 100 feet away and home again&mdash;that is, a
distance of 200 feet. One correspondent asks whether they take exactly
the same time in turning, to which I reply that they do. Another seems
to suspect that it is really a conundrum, and that the answer is that
'the result of the race was a (matrimonial) tie.' But I had no such
intention. The puzzle is an arithmetical one, as it purports to be."</p>

inches, and then find the greatest number of halfpennies that can be
placed within the enclosure under the following conditions. A
halfpenny is exactly an inch in diameter. Place your first halfpenny

an inch from the first, the third an inch distance from the second,
and so on. No halfpenny may touch another halfpenny or cross the
boundary. Our illustration will make the matter perfectly clear. No. 2
coin is an inch from No. 1; No. 3 an inch from No. 2; No. 4 an inch
from No. 3; but after No. 10 is placed we can go no further in this
attempt. Yet several more halfpennies might have been got in. How many
can the reader place?</p>

<p>One summer day in 1903 I was loitering on the Brighton front, watching
the people strolling about on the beach, when the friend who was with
me suddenly drew my attention to an individual who was standing alone,
and said, "Can you point out that man's wife? They are stopping at the
same hotel as I am, and the lady is one of those in view." After a few
minutes' observation, I was successful in indicating the lady
correctly. My friend was curious to know by what method of reasoning I
had arrived at the result. This was my answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We may at once exclude that Sister of Mercy and the girl in the short
frock; also the woman selling oranges. It cannot be the lady in
widows' weeds. It is not the lady in the bath chair, because she is
not staying at your hotel, for I happened to see her come out of a
private house this morning assisted by her maid. The two ladies in red
breakfasted at my hotel this morning, and as they were not wearing
outdoor dress I conclude they are staying there. It therefore rests
between the lady in blue and the one with the green parasol. But the
left hand that holds the parasol is, you see, ungloved and bears no
wedding-ring. Consequently I am driven to the conclusion that the lady
in blue is the man's wife&mdash;and you say this is correct."</p>

<p>Now, as my friend was an artist, and as I thought an amusing puzzle
might be devised on the lines of his question, I asked him to make me
a drawing according to some directions that I gave him, and I have
pleasure in presenting his production to my readers. It will be seen
that the picture shows six men and six ladies: Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and
11 are ladies, and Nos. 2, <span class='pagenum'>Pg 148<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are men. These twelve
individuals represent six married couples, all strangers to one
another, who, in walking aimlessly about, have got mixed up. But we
are only concerned with the man that is wearing a straw hat&mdash;Number
10. The puzzle is to find this man's wife. Examine the six ladies
carefully, and see if you can determine which one of them it is.</p>

<p>I showed the picture at the time to a few friends, and they expressed
very different opinions on the matter. One said, "I don't believe he
would marry a girl like Number 7." Another said, "I am sure a nice
girl like Number 3 would not marry such a fellow!" Another said, "It
must be Number 1, because she has got as far away as possible from the
brute!" It was suggested, again, that it must be Number 11, because
"he seems to be looking towards her;" but a cynic retorted, "For that
very reason, if he is really looking at her, I should say that she is
not his wife!"</p>

<p>I now leave the question in the hands of my readers. Which is really
Number 10's wife?</p>

<p>The illustration is of necessity considerably reduced from the large
scale on which it originally appeared in <i>The Weekly Dispatch</i> (24th
May 1903), but it is hoped that the details will be sufficiently clear
to allow the reader to derive entertainment from its examination. In
any case the solution given will enable him to follow the points with
interest.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Puzzles of this class are generally solved in the old books by the
tedious process of "working backwards." But a simple general solution
is as follows: If there are <i>n</i> players, the amount held by every
player at the end will be <i>m</i>(2<sup><i>n</i></sup>), the last winner must have held
<i>m</i>(<i>n</i>+1) at the start, the next <i>m</i>(2<i>n</i>+1), the next <i>m</i>(4<i>n</i>+1),
the next <i>m</i>(8<i>n</i>+1), and so on to the first player, who must have
held <i>m</i>(2<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup><i>n</i>+1).</p>

<p>Thus, in this case, <i>n</i> = 7, and the amount held by every player at the
end was 2<sup>7</sup> farthings. Therefore <i>m</i> = 1, and G started with 8
farthings, F with 15, E with 29, D with 57, C with 113, B with 225,
and A with 449 farthings.</p>

<p>The answer to this quite easy puzzle may, of course, be readily
obtained by trial, deducting the largest power of 7 that is contained
in one million dollars, then the next largest power from the
remainder, and so on. But the little problem is intended to illustrate
a simple direct method. The answer is given at once by converting
1,000,000 to the septenary scale, and it is on this subject of scales
of notation that I propose to write a few words for the benefit of
those who have never sufficiently considered the matter.</p>

<p>Our manner of figuring is a sort of perfected arithmetical shorthand,
a system devised to enable us to manipulate numbers as rapidly and
correctly as possible by means of symbols. If we write the number
2,341 to represent two thousand three hundred and forty-one dollars,
we wish to imply 1 dollar, added to four times 10 dollars, added to
three times 100 dollars, added to two times 1,000 dollars. From the
number in the units place on the right, every figure to the left is
understood to represent a multiple of the particular power of 10 that
its position indicates, while a cipher (0) must be inserted where
necessary in order to prevent confusion, for if instead of 207 we
wrote 27 it would be obviously misleading. We thus only require ten
figures, because directly a number exceeds 9 we put a second figure to
the left, directly it exceeds 99 we put a third figure to the left,
and so on. It will be seen that this is a purely arbitrary method. It
is working in the denary (or ten) scale of notation, a system
undoubtedly derived from the fact that our forefathers who devised it
had ten fingers upon which they were accustomed to count, like our
children of to-day. It is unnecessary for us ordinarily to state that
we are using the denary scale, because this is always understood in
the common affairs of life.</p>

<p>But if a man said that he had 6,553 dollars in the septenary (or
seven) scale of notation, you will find that this is precisely the
same amount as 2,341 in our ordinary denary scale. Instead of using
powers of ten, he uses powers of 7, so that he never needs any figure
higher than 6, and 6,553 really stands for 3, added to five times 7,
added to five times 49, added to six times 343 (in the ordinary
notation), or 2,341. To reverse the operation, and convert 2,341 from
the denary to the septenary scale, we divide it by 7, and get 334 and
remainder 3; divide 334 by 7, and get 47 and remainder 5; and so keep
on dividing by 7 as long as there is anything to divide. The
remainders, read backwards, 6, 5, 5, 3, give us the answer, 6,553.</p>

<p>Now, as I have said, our puzzle may be solved at once by merely
converting 1,000,000 dollars to the septenary scale. Keep on dividing
this number by 7 until there is nothing more left to divide, and the
remainders will be found to be 11333311 which is 1,000,000 expressed
in the septenary scale. Therefore, 1 gift of 1 dollar, 1 gift of 7
dollars, 3 gifts of 49 dollars, 3 gifts of 343 dollars, 3 gifts of
2,401 dollars, 3 gifts of 16,807 dollars, 1 gift of 117,649 dollars,
and one substantial gift of 823,543 dollars, satisfactorily solves our
problem. And it is the only possible solution. It is thus seen that no
"trials" are necessary; by converting to the septenary scale of
notation we go direct to the answer.</p>

<p>As a ching-chang is worth twopence and four-fifteenths of a
ching-chang, the remaining eleven-fifteenths of a ching-chang must be
worth twopence. Therefore eleven ching-changs are worth exactly thirty
pence, or half a crown. Now, the exchange must be made with seven
round-holed coins and one square-holed coin. Thus it will be seen that
7 round-holed coins are worth seven-elevenths of 15 ching-changs, and
1 square-holed coin is worth one-eleventh of 16 ching-changs&mdash;that is,
77 rounds equal 105 ching-changs and 11 squares equal 16 ching-changs.
Therefore 77 rounds added to 11 squares equal 121 ching-changs; or 7
rounds and 1 square equal 11 ching-changs, or its equivalent, half a
crown. This is more simple in practice than it looks here.</p>

<p>The way to help the American tradesman out of his dilemma is this.
Describing the coins by the number of cents that they represent, the
tradesman puts on the counter 50 and 25; the buyer puts down 100, 3,
and 2; the stranger adds his 10, 10, 5, 2, and 1. Now, considering
that the cost of the purchase amounted to 34 cents, it is clear that
out of this pooled money the tradesman has to receive 109, the buyer
71, and the stranger his 28 cents. Therefore it is obvious at a glance
that the 100-piece must go to the tradesman, and it then follows that
the 50-piece must go to the buyer, and then the 25-piece can only go
to the stranger. Another glance will now make it clear that the two
10-cent pieces must go to the buyer, because the tradesman now only
wants 9 and the stranger 3. Then it becomes obvious that the buyer
must take the 1 cent, that the stranger must take the 3 cents, and the
tradesman the 5, 2, and 2. To sum up, the tradesman takes 100, 5, 2,
and 2; the buyer, 50, 10, 10, and 1; the stranger, 25 and 3. It will
be seen that not one of the three persons retains any one of his own
coins.</p>

number of threepenny-pieces that may be laid on the surface of a

edge of the larger coin. Few people guess fewer than three, and many

<p>In tossing with the five pennies all at the same time, it is obvious
that there are 32 different ways in which the coins may fall, because

<p>I do not propose to give my method of solution. Any such explanation
would occupy an amount of space out of proportion to its interest or
value. If I could give within reasonable limits a general solution for
all money payments, I would strain a point to find room; but such a
solution would be extremely complex and cumbersome, and I do not
consider it worth the labour of working out.</p>

<p>Just to give an idea of what such a solution would involve, I will
merely say that I find that, dealing only with those sums of money
that are multiples of threepence, if we only use bronze coins any sum
can be paid in (<i>n</i>+1)<sup>2</sup> ways where <i>n</i> always represents the number
of pence. If threepenny-pieces are admitted, there are</p>

changes to 324 when the money is not such a multiple. And so the

<p>The grocer was delayed half a minute and the draper eight minutes and
a half (seventeen times as long as the grocer), making together nine
minutes. Now, the grocer took twenty-four minutes to weigh out the
sugar, and, with the half-minute delay, spent 24 min. 30 sec. over the
task; but the draper had only to make <i>forty-seven</i> cuts to divide the
roll of cloth, containing forty-eight yards, into yard pieces! This
took him 15 min. 40 sec., and when we add the eight minutes and a half
delay we get 24 min. 10 sec., from which it is clear that the draper
won the race by twenty seconds. The majority of solvers make
forty-eight cuts to divide the roll into forty-eight pieces!</p>

<p>As there were five droves with an equal number of animals in each
drove, the number must be divisible by 5; and as every one of the
eight dealers bought the same number of animals, the number must be
divisible by 8. Therefore the number must be a multiple of 40. The
highest possible multiple of 40 that will work will be found to be
120, and this number could be made up in one of two ways&mdash;1 ox, 23
pigs, and 96 sheep, or 3 oxen, 8 pigs, and 109 sheep. But the first is
excluded by the statement that the animals consisted of "oxen, pigs,
and sheep," because a single ox is not oxen. Therefore the second
grouping is the correct answer.</p>

<p>As there were the same number of boys as girls, it is clear that the
number of children must be even, and, apart from a careful and exact
reading of the question, there would be three different answers. There
might be two, six, or fourteen children. In the first of these cases
there <span class='pagenum'>Pg 152<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>are ten different ways in which the apples could be bought. But
we were told there was an equal number of "boys and girls," and one
boy and one girl are not boys and girls, so this case has to be
excluded. In the case of fourteen children, the only possible
distribution is that each child receives one halfpenny apple. But we
were told that each child was to receive an equal distribution of
"apples," and one apple is not apples, so this case has also to be
excluded. We are therefore driven back on our third case, which
exactly fits in with all the conditions. Three boys and three girls
each receive 1 halfpenny apple and 2 third-penny apples. The value of
these 3 apples is one penny and one-sixth, which multiplied by six
makes sevenpence. Consequently, the correct answer is that there were
six children&mdash;three girls and three boys.</p>

<p>In solving this little puzzle we are concerned with the exact
interpretation of the words used by the buyer and seller. I will give
the question again, this time adding a few words to make the matter
more clear. The added words are printed in italics.</p>

<p>"A man went into a shop to buy chestnuts. He said he wanted a
pennyworth, and was given five chestnuts. 'It is not enough; I ought
to have a sixth <i>of a chestnut more</i>,' he remarked. 'But if I give you
one chestnut more,' the shopman replied, 'you will have <i>five-sixths</i>
too many.' Now, strange to say, they were both right. How many
chestnuts should the buyer receive for half a crown?"</p>

<p>The answer is that the price was 155 chestnuts for half a crown.
Divide this number by 30, and we find that the buyer was entitled to
5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> chestnuts in exchange for his penny. He was, therefore, right
when he said, after receiving five only, that he still wanted a sixth.
And the salesman was also correct in saying that if he gave one
chestnut more (that is, six chestnuts in all) he would be giving
five-sixths of a chestnut in excess.</p>

<p>People give all sorts of absurd answers to this question, and yet it
is perfectly simple if one just considers that the salesman cannot
possibly have lost more than the cyclist actually stole. The latter
rode away with a bicycle which cost the salesman eleven pounds, and
the ten pounds "change;" he thus made off with twenty-one pounds, in
exchange for a worthless bit of paper. This is the exact amount of the
salesman's loss, and the other operations of changing the cheque and
borrowing from a friend do not affect the question in the slightest.
The loss of prospective profit on the sale of the bicycle is, of
course, not direct loss of money out of pocket.</p>

their ages was 44, Mary was 27&frac12; and Ann 16&frac12;. One is exactly 11 years
older than the other. I will now insert in brackets in the original
statement the various ages specified: "Mary is (27&frac12;) twice as old as
Ann was (13&frac34;) when Mary was half as old (24&frac34;) as Ann will be (49&frac12;)
when Ann is three times as old (49&frac12;) as Mary was (16&frac12;) when Mary was
(16&frac12;) three times as old as Ann (5&frac12;)." Now, check this backwards. When
Mary was three times as old as Ann, Mary was 16&frac12; and Ann 5&frac12; (11 years
younger). Then we get 49&frac12; for the age Ann will be when she is three
times as old as Mary was then. When Mary was half this she was 24&frac34;.
And at that time Ann must have been 13&frac34; (11 years younger). Therefore

<p>The first pair of times is 3 hr. 21<sup>57</sup>/<sub>143</sub> min. and 4 hr. 16<sup>112</sup>/<sub>143</sub>
min., and the last pair is 10 hr. 59<sup>83</sup>/<sub>143</sub> min. and 11 hr. 54<sup>138</sup>/<sub>143</sub>
min. I will not give all the remainder of the thirty-six pairs of
times, but supply a formula by which any of the sixty-six pairs that
occur from midday to midnight may be at once found:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='center' rowspan='2'>a hr</td><td align='center' class='bb'>720b&nbsp;+&nbsp;60a</td><td align='center' rowspan='2'>min. and b hr.</td><td align='center' class='bb'>720a&nbsp;+&nbsp;60b min.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='center'>143</td><td align='center'>143</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>For the letter a may be substituted any hour from 0, 1, 2, 3 up to 10
(where nought stands for 12 o'clock midday); and b may represent any
hour, later than a, up to 11.</p>

<p>By the aid of this formula there is no difficulty in discovering the
answer to the second question: a&nbsp;=&nbsp;8 and b&nbsp;=&nbsp;11 will give the pair 8
hr. 58<sup>106</sup>/<sub>143</sub> min. and 11 hr. 44<sup>128</sup>/<sub>143</sub> min., the latter being the
time when the minute hand is nearest of all to the point IX&mdash;in fact,
it is only <sup>15</sup>/<sub>143</sub> of a minute distant.</p>

<p>Readers may find it instructive to make a table of all the sixty-six
pairs of times when the hands of a clock change places. An easy way is
as follows: Make a column for the first times and a second column for
the second times of the pairs. By making a&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and b&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 in the above
expressions we find the first case, and enter hr. 5<sup>5</sup>/<sub>143</sub> min. at the
head of the first column, and 1 hr. 0<sup>60</sup>/<sub>143</sub> min. at the head of the
second column. Now, by successively adding 5<sup>5</sup>/<sub>143</sub> min. in the first,
and 1 hr. 0<sup>60</sup>/<sub>143</sub> min. in the second column, we get all the <i>eleven</i>
pairs in which the first time is a certain number of minutes after
nought, or mid-day. Then there is a "jump" in the times, but you can
find the next pair by making a&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and b&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, and then by successively
adding these two times as before you will get all the <i>ten</i> pairs
after 1 o'clock. Then there is another "jump," and you will be able to
get by addition all the <i>nine</i> pairs after 2 o'clock. And so on to the
end. I will leave readers to investigate for themselves the nature and
cause of the "jumps." In this way we get under the successive hours,
11&nbsp;+&nbsp;10&nbsp;+&nbsp;9&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;+&nbsp;7&nbsp;+&nbsp;6&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;66 pairs of times, which
result agrees with the formula in the first paragraph of this article.</p>

<p>Some time ago the principal of a Civil Service Training College, who
conducts a "Civil Service Column" in one of the periodicals, had the
query addressed to him, "How soon after XII o'clock will a clock with
both hands of the same length be ambiguous?" His first answer was,
"Some time past one o'clock," but he varied the answer from issue to
issue. At length some of his readers convinced him that the answer is,
"At 5<sup>5</sup>/<sub>143</sub> min. past XII;" and this he finally gave as correct,
together with the reason for it that at that time <i>the time indicated
is the same whichever hand you may assume as hour hand!</i></p>

<p>The positions of the hands shown in the illustration could only
indicate that the clock stopped at 44 min. 51<sup>1143</sup>/<sub>1427</sub> sec. after
eleven o'clock. The second hand would next be "exactly midway between
the other two hands" at 45 min. 52<sup>496</sup>/<sub>1427</sub> sec. after eleven o'clock.
If we had been dealing with the points on the circle to which the
three hands are directed, the answer would be 45 min. 22<sup>106</sup>/<sub>1427</sub> sec.
after eleven; but the question applied to the hands, and the second
hand would not be between the others at that time, but outside them.</p>

similar distances apart would be 54<sup>6</sup>/<sub>11</sub> min. past 2, when the second
hand would be at 32<sup>8</sup>/<sub>11</sub> sec. But you need only hold the watch (or our
previous illustration of it) in front of a mirror, when you will see
the second time reflected in it! Of course, when reflected, you will
read XI as I, X as II, and so on.</p>

<p>As a mere arithmetical problem this question presents no difficulty.
In order that the hands shall all point to twelve o'clock at the same
time, it is necessary that B shall gain at least twelve hours and that
C shall lose twelve hours. As B gains a minute in a day of twenty-four
hours, and C loses a minute in precisely the same time, it is evident
that one will have gained 720 minutes (just twelve hours) in 720 days,
and the other will have lost 720 minutes in 720 days. Clock A keeping
perfect time, all three clocks must indicate twelve o'clock
simultaneously at noon on the 720th day from April 1, 1898. What day
of the month will that be?</p>

<p>I published this little puzzle in 1898 to see <span class='pagenum'>Pg 155<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>how many people were
aware of the fact that 1900 would not be a leap year. It was
surprising how many were then ignorant on the point. Every year that
can be divided by four without a remainder is bissextile or leap year,
with the exception that one leap year is cut off in the century. 1800
was not a leap year, nor was 1900. On the other hand, however, to make
the calendar more nearly agree with the sun's course, every fourth
hundred year is still considered bissextile. Consequently, 2000, 2400,
2800, 3200, etc., will all be leap years. May my readers live to see
them. We therefore find that 720 days from noon of April 1, 1898,
brings us to noon of March 22, 1900.</p>

<p>Calling the three villages by their initial letters, it is clear that
the three roads form a triangle, A, B, C, with a perpendicular,
measuring twelve miles, dropped from C to the base A, B. This divides
our triangle into two right-angled triangles with a twelve-mile side
in common. It is then found that the distance from A to C is 15 miles,
from C to B 20 miles, and from A to B 25 (that is 9 and 16) miles.
These figures are easily proved, for the square of 12 added to the
square of 9 equals the square of 15, and the square of 12 added to the
square of 16 equals the square of 20.</p>

<p>The machine must have gone at the rate of seven-twenty-fourths of a

two-twenty-fourths, or one-twelfth of a mile per minute, the wind
being against it. The machine without any wind could therefore do the

possible is 981&nbsp;=&nbsp;235&nbsp;+&nbsp;746, or 657&nbsp;+&nbsp;324. The middle sum may be either 720
=134+586, or 702&nbsp;=&nbsp;134&nbsp;+&nbsp;568, or 407&nbsp;=&nbsp;138&nbsp;+&nbsp;269. The total in this case must
be made up of three of the figures 0, 2, 4, 7, but no sum other than
the three given can possibly be obtained. We have therefore no choice
in the case of the first locker, an alternative in the case of the
third, and any one of three arrangements in the case of the middle
locker. Here is one solution:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='center'>107</td><td align='center'>134</td><td align='center'>235</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Of course, in each case figures in the first two lines may be
exchanged vertically without altering the total, and as a result there
are just 3,072 different ways in which the figures might be actually
placed on the locker doors. I must content myself with showing one
little principle involved in this puzzle. The sum of the digits in the
total is always governed by the digit omitted. <sup>9</sup>/<sub>9</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>/<sub>10</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>/<sub>11</sub> -
<sup>3</sup>/<sub>12</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>13</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>/<sub>14</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>/<sub>15</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>/<sub>16</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>/<sub>17</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<sup>0</sup>/<sub>18</sub>. Whichever digit shown
here in the upper line we omit, the sum of the digits in the total
will be found beneath it. Thus in the case of locker A we omitted 8,
and the figures in the total sum up to 14. If, therefore, we wanted to
get 356, we may know at once to a certainty that it can only be
obtained (if at all) by dropping the 8.</p>

<p>In this case a certain amount of mere "trial" is unavoidable. But
there are two kinds of "trials"&mdash;those that are purely haphazard, and
those that are methodical. The true puzzle lover is never satisfied
with mere haphazard trials. The reader will find that by just
reversing the figures in 23 and 46 (making the multipliers 32 and 64)
both products will be 5,056. This is an improvement, but it is not the
correct answer. We can get as large a product as 5,568 if we multiply
174 by 32 and 96 by 58, but this solution is not to be found without
the exercise of some judgment and patience.</p>

<p>As I pointed out, it is quite easy so to arrange the counters that
they shall form a pair of simple multiplication sums, each of which
will give the same product&mdash;in fact, this can be done by anybody in
five minutes with a little patience. But it is quite another matter to
find that pair which gives the largest product and that which gives
the smallest product.</p>

<p>Now, in order to get the smallest product, it is necessary to select
as multipliers the two smallest possible numbers. If, therefore, we
place 1 and 2 as multipliers, all we have to do is to arrange the
remaining eight counters in such a way that they shall form two
numbers, one of which is just double the other; and in doing this we
must, of course, try to make the smaller number as low as possible. Of
course the lowest number we could get would be 3,045; but this will
not work, neither will 3,405, 3,450, etc., and it may be ascertained
that 3,485 is the lowest possible. One of the required answers is
3,485&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;6,970, and 6,970&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;6,970.</p>

<p>The other part of the puzzle (finding the pair with the highest
product) is, however, the real knotty point, for it is not at all easy
to discover whether we should let the multiplier consist of one or of
two figures, though it is clear that we must keep, so far as we can,
the largest figures to the left in both multiplier and multiplicand.
It will be seen that by the following arrangement so high a number as
58,560 may be obtained. Thus, 915&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;64&nbsp;=&nbsp;58,560, and 732&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;80&nbsp;=&nbsp;58,560.</p>

<p>Now, if we took every possible combination and tested it by
multiplication, we should need to make no fewer than 30,240 trials,
or, if we at once rejected the number 1 as a multiplier, 28,560
trials&mdash;a task that I think most people would be inclined to shirk.
But let us consider whether there be no shorter way of getting at the
results required. I have already explained that if you add together
the digits of any number and then, as often as necessary, add the
digits of the result, you must ultimately get a number composed of one
figure. This last number I call the "digital root." It is necessary in
every solution of our problem that the root of the sum of the digital
roots of our multipliers shall be the same as the root of their
product. There are only four ways in which this can happen: when the
digital roots of the multipliers are 3 and 6, or 9 and 9, or 2 and 2,
or 5 and 8. I have divided the twenty-two answers above into these
four classes. It is thus evident that the digital root of any product
in the first two classes must be 9, and in the second two classes 4.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that no number of five figures can have a digital
sum less than 15 or more than 35, we find that the figures of our
product must sum to either 18 or 27 to produce the root 9, and to
either 22 or 31 to produce the root 4. There are 3 ways of selecting
five different figures that add up to 18, there are 11 ways of
selecting five figures that add up to 27, there are 9 ways of
selecting five figures that add up to 22, and 5 ways of selecting five
figures that add up to 31. There are, therefore, 28 different groups,
and no more, from any one of which a product may be formed.</p>

<p>We next write out in a column these 28 sets of five figures, and
proceed to tabulate the possible factors, or multipliers, into which
they may be split. Roughly speaking, there would now appear to be
about 2,000 possible cases to be tried, instead of the 30,240
mentioned above; but the process of elimination now begins, and if the
reader has a quick eye and a clear head he can rapidly dispose of the
large bulk of these cases, and there will be comparatively few test
multiplications necessary. It would take far too much space to explain
my own method in detail, but I will take the first set of figures in
my table and show how easily it is done by the aid of little tricks
and dodges that should occur to everybody as he goes along.</p>

<p>My first product group of five figures is 84,321. Here, as we have
seen, the root of each factor must be 3 or a multiple of 3. As there
is no 6 or 9, the only single multiplier is 3. Now, the remaining four
figures can be arranged in 24 different ways, but there is no need to
make 24 multiplications. We see at a glance that, in order to get a
five-figure product, either the 8 or the 4 must be the first figure to
the left. But unless the 2 is preceded on the right by the 8, it will
produce when multiplied either a 6 or a 7, which must not occur. We
are, therefore, reduced at once to the two cases, 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4,128 and 3 &times;
4,281, both of which give correct solutions. Suppose next that we are
trying the two-figure factor, 21. Here we see that if the number to be
multiplied is under 500 the product will either have only four figures
or begin with 10. Therefore we have only to examine the cases 21&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;843
and 21&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;834. But we know that the first figure will be repeated, and
that the second figure will be twice the first figure added to the
second. Consequently, as twice 3 added to 4 produces a nought in our
product, the first case is at once rejected. It only remains to try
the remaining case by multiplication, when we find it does not give a
correct answer. If we are next trying the factor 12, we see at the
start that neither the 8 nor the 3 can be in the units place, because
they would produce a 6, and so on. A sharp eye and an alert judgment
will enable us thus to run through our table in a much shorter time
than would be expected. The process took me a little more than three
hours.</p>

<p>I have not attempted to enumerate the solutions in the cases of six,
seven, eight, and nine digits, but I have recorded nearly fifty
examples with nine digits alone.</p>

cases all the nine digits are used once and once only.</p>

<p>It is convenient to consider the digits as arranged to form fractions
of the respective values, one-half, one-third, one-fourth, one-fifth,
one-sixth, one-seventh, one-eighth, and one-ninth. I will first give
the eight answers, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The sum of the numerator digits and the denominator digits will, of
course, always be 45, and the "digital root" is 9. Now, if we separate
the nine digits into any two groups, the sum of the two digital roots
will always be 9. In fact, the two digital roots must be either 9&mdash;9,
8&mdash;1, 7&mdash;2, 6&mdash;3, or 5&mdash;4. In the first case the actual sum is 18, but
then the digital root of this number is itself 9. The solutions in the
cases of one-third, one-fourth, one-sixth, one-seventh, and one-ninth
must be of the form 9&mdash;9; that is to say, the digital roots of both
numerator and denominator will be 9. In the cases of one-half and
one-fifth, however, the digital roots are 6&mdash;3, but of course the
higher root may occur either in the numerator or in the denominator;
thus <sup>2697</sup>/<sub>13485</sub>, <sup>2769</sup>/<sub>13845</sub>, <sup>2973</sup>/<sub>14865</sub>, <sup>3729</sup>/<sub>18645</sub>, where, in the
first two arrangements, the roots of the numerator and denominator are
respectively 6&mdash;3, and in the last two 3&mdash;6. The most curious case of
all is, perhaps, one-eighth, for here the digital roots may be of any
one of the five forms given above.</p>

<p>The denominators of the fractions being regarded as the numerators
multiplied by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, we must pay
attention to the "carryings over." In order to get five figures in the
product there will, of course, always be a carry-over after
multiplying the last figure to the left, and in every case higher than
4 we must carry over at least three times. Consequently in cases from
one-fifth to one-ninth we cannot produce different solutions by a mere
change of position of pairs of figures, as, for example, we may with
<sup>5832</sup>/<sub>17496</sub> and <sup>5823</sup>/<sub>17469</sub>, where the <sup>2</sup>/<sub>6</sub> and <sup>3</sup>/<sub>9</sub> change places. It is
true that the same figures may often be differently arranged, as shown
in the two pairs of values for one-fifth that I have given in the last
paragraph, but here it will be found there is a general readjustment
of figures and not a simple changing of the positions of pairs. There
are other little points that would occur to every solver&mdash;such as that
the figure 5 cannot ever appear to the extreme right of the numerator,
as this would result in our getting either a nought or a second 5 in
the denominator. Similarly 1 cannot ever appear in the same position,
nor 6 in the fraction one-sixth, nor an even figure in the fraction
one-fifth, and so on. The preliminary consideration of such points as
I have touched upon will not only prevent our wasting a lot of time in
trying to produce impossible forms, but will lead us more or less
directly to the desired solutions.</p>

<p>The problem of expressing the number 100 as a mixed number or
fraction, using all the nine digits once, and once only, has, like all
these digital puzzles, a fascinating side to it. The merest tyro can
by patient trial obtain correct results, and there is a singular
pleasure in discovering and recording each new arrangement akin to the
delight of the botanist in finding some long-sought plant. It is
simply a matter of arranging those nine figures correctly, and yet
with the thousands of possible combinations that confront us the task
is not so easy as might at first appear, if we are to get a
considerable number of results. Here are eleven answers, including the
one I gave as a specimen:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>

<p>Now, as all the fractions necessarily represent whole numbers, it will
be convenient to deal with them in the following form: 96&nbsp;+&nbsp;4, 94&nbsp;+&nbsp;6,
91&nbsp;+&nbsp;9, 82&nbsp;+&nbsp;18, 81&nbsp;+&nbsp;19, and 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;97.</p>

<p>With any whole number the digital roots of the fraction that brings it
up to 100 will always be of one particular form. Thus, in the case of
96&nbsp;+&nbsp;4, one can say at once that if any answers are obtainable, then
the roots of both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction
will be 6. Examine the first three arrangements given above, and you
will find that this is so. In the case of 94&nbsp;+&nbsp;6 the roots of the
numerator and denominator will be respectively 3&mdash;2, in the case of 91
+ 9 and of 82&nbsp;+&nbsp;18 they will be 9&mdash;8, in the case of 81&nbsp;+&nbsp;19 they will
be 9&mdash;9, and in the case of 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;97 they will be 3&mdash;3. Every fraction
that can be employed has, therefore, its particular digital root form,
and you are only wasting your time in unconsciously attempting to
break through this law.</p>

<p>Every reader will have perceived that certain whole numbers are
evidently impossible. Thus, if there is a 5 in the whole number, there
will also be a nought or a second 5 in the fraction, which are barred
by the conditions. Then multiples of 10, such as 90 and 80, cannot of
course occur, nor can the whole number conclude with a 9, like 89 and
79, because the fraction, equal to 11 or 21, will have 1 in the last
place, and will therefore repeat a figure. Whole numbers that repeat a
figure, such as 88 and 77, are also clearly useless. These cases, as I
have said, are all obvious to every reader. But when I declare <span class='pagenum'>Pg 159<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>that
such combinations as 98&nbsp;+&nbsp;2, 92&nbsp;+&nbsp;8, 86&nbsp;+&nbsp;14, 83&nbsp;+&nbsp;17, 74&nbsp;+&nbsp;26, etc.,
etc., are to be at once dismissed as impossible, the reason is not so
evident, and I unfortunately cannot spare space to explain it.</p>

<p>But when all those combinations have been struck out that are known to
be impossible, it does not follow that all the remaining "possible
forms" will actually work. The elemental form may be right enough, but
there are other and deeper considerations that creep in to defeat our
attempts. For example, 98&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 is an impossible combination, because we
are able to say at once that there is no possible form for the digital
roots of the fraction equal to 2. But in the case of 97&nbsp;+&nbsp;3 there is a
possible form for the digital roots of the fraction, namely, 6&mdash;5, and
it is only on further investigation that we are able to determine that
this form cannot in practice be obtained, owing to curious
considerations. The working is greatly simplified by a process of
elimination, based on such considerations as that certain
multiplications produce a repetition of figures, and that the whole
number cannot be from 12 to 23 inclusive, since in every such case
sufficiently small denominators are not available for forming the
fractional part.</p>

<p>The point of the present puzzle lies in the fact that the numbers 15
and 18 are not capable of solution. There is no way of determining
this without trial. Here are answers for the ten possible numbers:&mdash;</p>

<p>I have only found the one arrangement for each of the numbers 16, 20,
and 27; but the other numbers are all capable of being solved in more
than one way. As for 15 and 18, though these may be easily solved as a
simple fraction, yet a "mixed fraction" assumes the presence of a
whole number; and though my own idea for dodging the conditions is the
following, where the fraction is both complex and mixed, it will be
fairer to keep exactly to the form indicated:&mdash;</p>

<p>I have proved the possibility of solution for all numbers up to 100,
except 1, 2, 3, 4, 15, and 18. The first three are easily shown to be
impossible. I have also noticed that numbers whose digital root is
8&mdash;such as 26, 35, 44, 53, etc.&mdash;seem to lend themselves to the
greatest number of answers. For the number 26 alone I have recorded no
fewer than twenty-five different arrangements, and I have no doubt
that there are many more.</p>

<p>Most people know that if the sum of the digits in the odd places of
any number is the same as the sum of the digits in the even places,
then the number is divisible by 11 without remainder. Thus in
896743012 the odd digits, 20468, add up 20, and the even digits, 1379,
also add up 20. Therefore the number may be divided by 11. But few
seem to know that if the difference between the sum of the odd and the
even digits is 11, or a multiple of 11, the rule equally applies. This
law enables us to find, with a very little trial, that the smallest
number containing nine of the ten digits (calling nought a digit) that
is divisible by 11 is 102,347,586, and the highest number possible,
987,652,413.</p>

<p>There is a very large number of different ways in which arithmetical
signs may be placed between the nine digits, arranged in numerical
order, so as to give an expression equal to 100. In fact, unless the
reader investigated the matter very closely, he might not suspect that
so many ways are possible. It was for this reason that I added the
condition that not only must the fewest possible signs be used, but
also the fewest possible strokes. In this way we limit the problem to
a single solution, and arrive at the simplest and therefore (in this
case) the best result.</p>

<p>Just as in the case of magic squares there are methods by which we may
write down with the greatest ease a large number of solutions, but not
all the solutions, so there are several ways in which we may quickly
arrive at dozens of arrangements of the "Digital Century," without
finding all the possible arrangements. There is, in fact, very little
principle in the thing, and there is no certain way of demonstrating
that we have got the best possible solution. All I can say is that the
arrangement I shall give as the best is the best I have up to the
present succeeded in discovering. I will give the reader a few
interesting specimens, the first being the solution usually published,
and the last the best solution that I know.</p>

<p>The way to write four sevens with simple arithmetical signs so that

<div class='center'>
<sup>7</sup>/<sub>.7</sub>&times;<sup>7</sup>/<sub>.7</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;100.

<p>Of course the fraction, 7 over decimal 7, equals 7 divided by <sup>7</sup>/<sub>10</sub>,
which is the same as 70 divided by 7, or 10. Then 10 multiplied by 10
is 100, and there you are! It will be seen that this solution applies
equally to any number whatever that you may substitute for 7.</p>

<p>The sum of all the numbers that can be formed with any given set of
four different figures is always 6,666 multiplied by the sum of the
four figures. Thus, 1, 2, 3, 4 add up 10, and ten times 6,666 is
66,660. Now, there are thirty-five different ways of selecting four
figures from the seven on the dice&mdash;remembering the 6 and 9 trick. The
figures of all these thirty-five groups add up to 600. Therefore 6,666
multiplied by 600 gives us 3,999,600 as the correct answer.</p>

<p>Let us discard the dice and deal with the problem generally, using the
nine digits, but excluding nought. Now, if you were given simply the
sum of the digits&mdash;that is, if the condition were that you could use
any four figures so long as they summed to a given amount&mdash;then we
have to remember that several combinations of four digits will, in
many cases, make the same sum.</p>

<p>Here the top row of numbers gives all the possible sums of four
different figures, and the bottom row the number of different ways in
which each sum may be made. For example 13 may be made in three ways:
1237, 1246, and 1345. It will be found that the numbers in the bottom
row add up to 126, which is the number of combinations of nine figures
taken four at a time. From this table we may at once calculate the
answer to such a question as this: What is the sum of all the numbers
composed of our different digits (nought excluded) that add up to 14?
Multiply 14 by the number beneath t in the table, 5, and multiply the
result by 6,666, and you will have the answer. It follows that, to
know the sum of all the numbers composed of four different digits, if
you multiply all the pairs in the two rows and then add the results
together, you will get 2,520, which, multiplied by 6,666, gives the
answer 16,798,320.</p>

<p>The following general solution for any number of digits will
doubtless interest readers. Let n represent number of digits, then 5
(10<sup>n</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1) ) 8! divided by (9&nbsp;-&nbsp;n)! equals the required sum.
Note that 0! equals 1. This may be reduced to the following practical
rule: Multiply together 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5 ... to (n&nbsp;-&nbsp;1)
factors; now add (n&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) ciphers to the right, and from this result
subtract the same set of figures with a single cipher to the right. Thus
for n&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 (as in the case last mentioned), 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6&nbsp;=&nbsp;168.
Therefore 16,800,000 less 1,680 gives us 16,798,320 in another way.</p>

<p>The ordinary schoolboy would correctly treat this as a quadratic
equation. Here is the actual arithmetic. Double the product of the two
distances from the walls. This gives us 144, which is the square of
12. The sum of the two distances is 17. If we add these two numbers,
12 and 17, together, and also subtract one from the other, we get the
two answers that 29 or 5 was the radius, or half-diameter, of the
table. Consequently, the full diameter was 58 in. or 10 in. But a
table of the latter dimensions would be absurd, and not at all in

120 lbs. We thus know that A, B, D, and E weigh together 231 lbs.,

<p>The general solution is curious. Call the number of figures in each
half of the torn label n. Then, if we add 1 to each of the exponents
of the prime factors (other than 3) of 10<sup>n</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 (1 being regarded as a
factor with the constant exponent, 1), their product will be the
number of solutions. Thus, for a label of six figures, n&nbsp;=&nbsp;3. The
factors of 10<sup>n</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 are 1<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;37<sup>1</sup> (not considering the 3<sup>3</sup>), and the
product of 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, the number of solutions. This always includes
the special cases 98&nbsp;-&nbsp;01, 00&nbsp;-&nbsp;01, 998&nbsp;-&nbsp;01, 000&nbsp;-&nbsp;001, etc. The
solutions are obtained as follows:&mdash;Factorize 10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 in all possible
ways, always keeping the powers of 3 together, thus, 37&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;27, 999&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1.
Then solve the equation 37x&nbsp;=&nbsp;27y&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. Here x&nbsp;=&nbsp;19 and y&nbsp;=&nbsp;26.
Therefore, 19&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;37&nbsp;=&nbsp;703, the square of which gives one label,
494,209. A complementary solution (through 27x&nbsp;=&nbsp;37x&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) can at once
be found by 10<sup>n</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;703&nbsp;=&nbsp;297, the square of which gives 088,209 for

included, though they lead to peculiar cases like 00238&nbsp;-&nbsp;04641 =

can write at once 998,001, according to the law shown above, by adding
nines on one half and noughts on the other, and its complementary will
be 1 preceded by five noughts, or 000001. Thus we get the squares of
999 and 1. These are the four solutions.</p>

<p>As we are not told in what year Mr. Jasper Bullyon made the generous
distribution of his accumulated wealth, but are required to find the
lowest possible amount of money, it is clear that we must look for a
year of the most favourable form.</p>

<p>There are four cases to be considered&mdash;an ordinary year with fifty-two
Sundays and with fifty-three Sundays, and a leap-year with fifty-two
and fifty-three Sundays respectively. Here are the lowest possible
amounts in each case:&mdash;</p>

<p>The lowest possible amount, and therefore the correct answer, is
&pound;19,345, distributed in an ordinary year that began on a Sunday. The

<p>Though this puzzle presents no great difficulty to any one possessing
a knowledge of algebra, it has perhaps rather interesting features.</p>

<p>Seeing, as one does in the illustration, just one corner of the
proposed square, one is scarcely prepared for the fact that the field,
in order to comply with the conditions, must contain exactly 501,760
acres, the fence requiring the same number of rails. Yet this is the
correct answer, and the only answer, and if that gentleman in Iowa
carries out his intention, his field will be twenty-eight miles long
on each side, and a little larger than the county of Westmorland. I am
not aware that any limit has ever been fixed to the size of a "field,"
though they do not run so large as this in Great Britain. Still, out
in Iowa, where my correspondent resides, they do these things on a
very big scale. I have, however, reason to believe that when he finds
the sort of task he has set himself, he will decide to abandon it; for
if that cow decides to roam to fresh woods and pastures new, the
milkmaid may have to start out a week in advance in order to obtain
the morning's milk.</p>

<p>Here is a little rule that will always apply where the length of the
rail is half a pole. Multiply the number of rails in a hurdle by four,
and the result is the exact number of miles in the side of a square
field containing the same number of acres as there are rails in the
complete fence. Thus, with a one-rail fence the field is four miles
square; a two-rail fence gives eight miles square; a three-rail fence,
twelve miles square; and so on, until we find that a seven-rail fence
multiplied by four gives a field of twenty-eight miles square. In the
case of our present problem, if the field be made smaller, then the
number of rails will exceed the number of acres; while if the field be
made larger, the number of rails will be less than the acres of the
field.</p>

<p>Though this problem might strike the novice as being rather difficult,
it is, as a matter of fact, quite easy, and is made still easier by
inserting four out of the ten numbers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 163<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>First, it will be found that squares that are diametrically opposite
have a common difference. For example, the difference between the
square of 14 and the square of 2, in the diagram, is 192; and the
difference between the square of 16 and the square of 8 is also 192.
This must be so in every case. Then it should be remembered that the
difference between squares of two consecutive numbers is always twice
the smaller number plus 1, and that the difference between the squares
of any two numbers can always be expressed as the difference of the
numbers multiplied by their sum. Thus the square of 5 (25) less the
square of 4 (16) equals (2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4)&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, or 9; also, the square of 7 (49)
less the square of 3 (9) equals (7&nbsp;+&nbsp;3)&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;(7&nbsp;-&nbsp;3), or 40.</p>

<p>Now, the number 192, referred to above, may be divided into five
different pairs of even factors: 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;96, 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;48, 6&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;32, 8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;24, and
12&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;16, and these divided by 2 give us, 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;48, 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;24, 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;16, 4 &times;
12, and 6&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;8. The difference and sum respectively of each of these
pairs in turn produce 47, 49; 22, 26; 13, 19; 8, 16; and 2, 14. These
are the required numbers, four of which are already placed. The six
numbers that have to be added may be placed in just six different
ways, one of which is as follows, reading round the circle clockwise:
16, 2, 49, 22, 19, 8, 14, 47, 26, 13.</p>

<p>I will just draw the reader's attention to one other little point. In
all circles of this kind, the difference between diametrically
opposite numbers increases by a certain ratio, the first numbers (with
the exception of a circle of 6) being 4 and 6, and the others formed
by doubling the next preceding but one. Thus, in the above case, the
first difference is 2, and then the numbers increase by 4, 6, 8, and
12. Of course, an infinite number of solutions may be found if we
admit fractions. The number of squares in a circle of this kind must,
however, be of the form 4n&nbsp;+&nbsp;6; that is, it must be a number composed
of 6 plus a multiple of 4.</p>

<p>Any number (not itself a square number) may be multiplied by a square
that will give a product 1 less than another square. The given number
must not itself be a square, because a square multiplied by a square
produces a square, and no square plus 1 can be a square. My remarks
throughout must be understood to apply to whole numbers, because
fractional soldiers are not of much use in war.</p>

<p>Now, of all the numbers from 2 to 99 inclusive, 61 happens to be the
most awkward one to work, and the lowest possible answer to our puzzle
is that Harold's army consisted of 3,119,882,982,860,264,400 men. That
is, there would be 51,145,622,669,840,400 men (the square of
226,153,980) in each of the sixty-one squares. Add one man (Harold),
and they could then form one large square with 1,766,319,049 men on
every side. The general problem, of which this is a particular case,
is known as the "Pellian Equation"&mdash;apparently because Pell neither
first propounded the question nor first solved it! It was issued as a
challenge by Fermat to the English mathematicians of his day. It is
readily solved by the use of continued fractions.</p>

<p>Next to 61, the most difficult number under 100 is 97, where
97&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6,377,352<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;a square.</p>

<p>The reason why I assumed that there must be something wrong with the
figures in the chronicle is that we can confidently say that Harold's
army did not contain over three trillion men! If this army (not to
mention the Normans) had had the whole surface of the earth (sea
included) on which to encamp, each man would have had slightly more
than a quarter of a square inch of space in which to move about! Put
another way: Allowing one square foot of standing-room per man, each
small square would have required all the space allowed by a globe
three times the diameter of the earth.</p>

<p>A little thought will make it clear that the answer must be
fractional, and that in one case the numerator will be greater and in
the other case less than the denominator. As a matter of fact, the
height of the larger cube must be <sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub> ft., and of the smaller <sup>3</sup>/<sub>7</sub> ft.,
if we are to have the answer in the smallest possible figures. Here
the lineal measurement is <sup>11</sup>/<sub>7</sub> ft.&mdash;that is, 1<sup>4</sup>/<sub>7</sub> ft. What are the
cubic contents of the two cubes? First <sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>/<sub>7</sub>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>512</sup>/<sub>343</sub>, and
secondly <sup>3</sup>/<sub>7</sub>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>/<sub>7</sub>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>/<sub>7</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>/<sub>343</sub>. Add these together and the result
is <sup>539</sup>/<sub>343</sub>, which reduces to <sup>11</sup>/<sub>7</sub> or 1<sup>4</sup>/<sub>7</sub> ft. We thus see that the
answers in cubic feet and lineal feet are precisely the same.</p>

<p>The germ of the idea is to be found in the works of Diophantus of
Alexandria, who wrote about the beginning of the fourth century. These
fractional numbers appear in triads, and are obtained from three
generators, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, where <i>a</i> is the largest and <i>c</i> the
smallest.</p>

<p>Then <i>ab</i>+<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>=denominator, and <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>-<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>, <i>b</i><sup>2</sup>-<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>,
and <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>-<i>b</i><sup>2</sup> will be the three numerators. Thus, using the
generators 3, 2, 1, we get <sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub>, <sup>3</sup>/<sub>7</sub>, <sup>5</sup>/<sub>7</sub> and we can pair the first and
second, as in the above solution, or the first and third for a second
solution. The denominator must always be a prime number of the form
6<i>n</i>+1, or composed of such primes. Thus you can have 13, 19, etc., as
denominators, but not 25, 55, 187, etc.</p>

<p>When the principle is understood there is no difficulty in writing
down the dimensions of as many sets of cubes as the most exacting
collector may require. If the reader would like one, for example, with
plenty of nines, perhaps the following would satisfy him:
<sup>99999999</sup>/<sub>99990001</sub> and <sup>19999</sup>/<sub>99990001</sub>.</p>

occur. If I had asked for the smallest aggregate number of coins, the
answer would have been 482, 3,362, and 6,242. It will be found in
either case that if the contents of any two of the three boxes be
combined, they form a square number of coins. It is a curious
coincidence (nothing more, for it will not always happen) that in the
first solution the digits of the three numbers add to 17 in every
case, and in the second solution to 14. It should be noted that the
middle one of the three numbers will always be half a square.</p>

<p>These will be found to work correctly. All the rest of the 704
answers, where Alfonso always holds six doubloons, may be obtained in
this way from the two tables by substituting the different numbers for
the letters m and n.</p>

<p>Put in another way, for every holding of Alfonso the number of answers
is the sum of two arithmetical progressions, the common difference in
one case being 1 and in the other -4. Thus in the case where Alfonso
holds 6 doubloons one progression is 33&nbsp;+&nbsp;34&nbsp;+&nbsp;35&nbsp;+&nbsp;36&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;43 +
44, and the other 42&nbsp;+&nbsp;38&nbsp;+&nbsp;34&nbsp;+&nbsp;30&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;6&nbsp;+&nbsp;2. The sum of the
first series is 462, and of the second 242&mdash;results which again agree
with the figures already given. The problem may be said to consist in
finding the first and last terms of these progressions. I should
remark that where Alfonso holds 9, 10, or 11 there is only one
progression, of the second form.</p>

<p>In order that a number of sixpences may not be divisible into a number
of equal piles, it is necessary that the number should be a prime. If
the banker can bring about a prime number, he will win; and I will
show how he can always do this, whatever the customer may put in the
box, and that therefore the banker will win to a certainty. The banker
must first deposit forty sixpences, and then, no matter how many the
customer may add, he will desire the latter to transfer from the
counter the square of the number next below what the customer put in.
Thus, banker puts 40, customer, we will say, adds 6, then transfers
from the counter 25 (the square of 5), which leaves 71 in all, a prime
number. Try again. Banker puts 40, customer adds 12, then transfers
121 (the square of 11), as desired, which leaves 173, a prime number.
The key to the puzzle is the curious fact that any number up to 39, if
added to its square and the sum increased by 41, makes a prime number.
This was first discovered by Euler, the great mathematician. It has
been suggested that the banker might desire the customer to transfer
sufficient to raise the contents of the box to a given number; but
this would not only make the thing an absurdity, but breaks the rule
that neither knows what the other puts in.</p>

<p>The puzzle amounts to this. Find the smallest square number that may
be expressed as the sum of more than three consecutive cubes, the cube
1 being barred. As more than three heaps were to be supplied, this
condition shuts out the otherwise smallest answer, 23<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;24<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;25<sup>3</sup>
= 204<sup>2</sup>. But it admits the answer, 25<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;26<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;27<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;28<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;29<sup>3</sup> =
315<sup>2</sup>. The correct answer, however, requires more heaps, but a smaller
aggregate number of blocks. Here it is: 14<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;15<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;... up to 25<sup>3</sup>
inclusive, or twelve heaps in all, which, added together, make 97,344
blocks of stone that may be laid out to form a square 312&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;312. I
will just remark that one key to the solution lies in what are called
triangular numbers. (See pp. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>, <a href="#Page_25">25</a>, and <a href="#Page_166">166</a>.)</p>

<p>The smallest primes of the form 4n&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 are 5, 13, 17, 29, and 37, and
the smallest of the form 4n&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 are 3, 7, 11, 19, and 23. Now, primes
of the first form can always be expressed as the sum of two squares,
and in only one way. Thus, 5&nbsp;=&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;1; 13&nbsp;=&nbsp;9&nbsp;+&nbsp;4; 17&nbsp;=&nbsp;16&nbsp;+&nbsp;1; 29&nbsp;=&nbsp;25
+ 4; 37&nbsp;=&nbsp;36&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. But primes of the second form can never be
expressed as the sum of two squares in any way whatever.</p>

<p>In order that a number may be expressed as the sum of two squares in
several different ways, it is necessary that it shall be a composite
number containing a certain number of primes of our first form. Thus,
5 or 13 alone can only be so expressed in one way; but 65, (5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;13),
can be expressed in two ways, 1,105, (5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;13&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;17), in four ways,
32,045, (5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;13&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;17&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;29), in eight ways. We thus get double as many
ways for every new factor of this form that we introduce. Note,
however, that I say <i>new</i> <span class='pagenum'>Pg 166<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>factor, for the <i>repetition</i> of factors is
subject to another law. We cannot express 25, (5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5), in two ways,
but only in one; yet 125, (5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5), can be given in two ways, and
so can 625, (5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5); while if we take in yet another 5 we can
express the number as the sum of two squares in three different ways.</p>

<p>If a prime of the second form gets into your composite number, then
that number cannot be the sum of two squares. Thus 15, (3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5), will
not work, nor will 135, (3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5); but if we take in an even
number of 3's it will work, because these 3's will themselves form a
square number, but you will only get one solution. Thus, 45, (3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3 &times;
5, or 9&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5)&nbsp;=&nbsp;36&nbsp;+&nbsp;9. Similarly, the factor 2 may always occur, or
any power of 2, such as 4, 8, 16, 32; but its introduction or omission
will never affect the number of your solutions, except in such a case
as 50, where it doubles a square and therefore gives you the two
answers, 49&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 and 25&nbsp;+&nbsp;25.</p>

<p>Now, directly a number is decomposed into its prime factors, it is
possible to tell at a glance whether or not it can be split into two
squares; and if it can be, the process of discovery in how many ways
is so simple that it can be done in the head without any effort. The
number I gave was 130. I at once saw that this was 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;13, and
consequently that, as 65 can be expressed in two ways (64&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 and 49 +
16), 130 can also be expressed in two ways, the factor 2 not affecting
the question.</p>

<p>The smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two squares in
twelve different ways is 160,225, and this is therefore the smallest
army that would answer the Sultan's purpose. The number is composed of
the factors 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;13&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;17&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;29, each of which is of the required
form. If they were all different factors, there would be sixteen ways;
but as one of the factors is repeated, there are just twelve ways.
Here are the sides of the twelve pairs of squares: (400 and 15), (399
and 32), (393 and 76), (392 and 81), (384 and 113), (375 and 140),
(360 and 175), (356 and 183), (337 and 216), (329 and 228), (311 and
252), (265 and 300). Square the two numbers in each pair, add them
together, and their sum will in every case be 160,225.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sandy McAllister will have to save a tremendous sum out of her
housekeeping allowance if she is to win that sixth present that her
canny husband promised her. And the allowance must be a very liberal
one if it is to admit of such savings. The problem required that we
should find five numbers higher than 36 the units of which may be
displayed so as to form a square, a triangle, two triangles, and three
triangles, using the complete number in every one of the four cases.</p>

<p>Every triangular number is such that if we multiply it by 8 and add 1
the result is an odd square number. For example, multiply 1, 3, 6, 10,
15 respectively by 8 and add 1, and we get 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, which
are the squares of the odd numbers 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Therefore in every
case where 8x<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;a square number, x<sup>2</sup> is also a triangular. This
point is dealt with in our puzzle, "The Battle of Hastings." I will
now merely show again how, when the first solution is found, the
others may be discovered without any difficulty. First of all, here
are the figures:&mdash;</p>

</table></div>

<p>and so on. Look for the numbers in the table above, and the method
will explain itself.</p>

<p>Thus we find that the numbers 36, 1225, 41616, 1413721, 48024900, and
1631432881 will form squares with sides of 6, 35, 204, 1189, 6930, and
40391; and they will also form single triangles with sides of 8, 49,
288, 1681, 9800, and 57121. These numbers may be obtained from the
last column in the first table above in this way: simply divide the
numbers by 2 and reject the remainder. Thus the integral halves of 17,
99, and 577 are 8, 49, and 288.</p>

<p>All the numbers we have found will form either two or three triangles
at will. The following little diagram will show you graphically at a
glance that every square number must necessarily be the sum of two
triangulars, and that the side of one triangle will be the same as the
side of the corresponding square, while the other will be just 1 less.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/a137.png" width="400" height="206" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Thus a square may always be divided easily into two triangles, and the
sum of two consecutive triangulars will always make a square. In
numbers it is equally clear, for if we examine the first
triangulars&mdash;1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28&mdash;we find that by adding all the
consecutive pairs in turn we get the series of square numbers&mdash;9, 16,
25, 36, 49, etc.</p>

<p>The method of forming three triangles from our numbers is equally
direct, and not at all a matter of trial. But I must content myself
with giving actual figures, and just stating that every triangular
higher than 6 will form three triangulars. I give the sides of the
triangles, and readers will know from my remarks when stat<span class='pagenum'>Pg 167<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>ing the
puzzle how to find from these sides the number of counters or coins in
each, and so check the results if they so wish.</p>

<p>I should perhaps explain that the arrangements given in the last two
columns are not the only ways of forming two and three triangles.
There are others, but one set of figures will fully serve our purpose.
We thus see that before Mrs. McAllister can claim her sixth &pound;5 present
she must save the respectable sum of &pound;1,631,432,881.</p>

<p>Here in the first row we place in regular order the natural numbers.
Each number in the second row represents the sum of the numbers in the
row above, from the beginning to the number just over it. Thus 1, 2,
3, 4, added together, make 10. The third row is formed in exactly the
same way as the second. In the fourth row every number is formed by
adding together the number just above it and the preceding number.
Thus 4 and 10 make 14, 20 and 35 make 55. Now, all the numbers in the
second row are triangular numbers, which means that these numbers of
cannon balls may be laid out on the ground so as to form equilateral
triangles. The numbers in the third row will all form our triangular
pyramids, while the numbers in the fourth row will all form square
pyramids.</p>

<p>Thus the very process of forming the above numbers shows us that every
square pyramid is the sum of two triangular pyramids, one of which has
the same number of balls in the side at the base, and the other one
ball fewer. If we continue the above table to twenty-four places, we
shall reach the number 4,900 in the fourth row. As this number is the
square of 70, we can lay out the balls in a square, and can form a
square pyramid with them. This manner of writing out the series until
we come to a square number does not appeal to the mathematical mind,
but it serves to show how the answer to the particular puzzle may be
easily arrived at by anybody. As a matter of fact, I confess my
failure to discover any number other than 4,900 that fulfils the
conditions, nor have I found any rigid proof that this is the only
answer. The problem is a difficult one, and the second answer, if it
exists (which I do not believe), certainly runs into big figures.</p>

<p>For the benefit of more advanced mathematicians I will add that the
general expression for square pyramid numbers is (2n<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;3n<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;n)/6.
For this expression to be also a square number (the special case of 1
excepted) it is necessary that n&nbsp;=&nbsp;p<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;6t<sup>2</sup>, where 2p<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 =
q<sup>2</sup> (the "Pellian Equation"). In the case of our solution above, n =
24, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;5, t&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, q&nbsp;=&nbsp;7.</p>

<p>The money paid in every case was a square number of shillings, because
they bought 1 at 1<i>s</i>., 2 at 2<i>s</i>., 3 at 3<i>s</i>., and so on. But every husband
pays altogether 63<i>s</i>. more than his wife, so we have to find in how
many ways 63 may be the difference between two square numbers. These
are the three only possible ways: the square of 8 less the square of
1, the square of 12 less the square of 9, and the square of 32 less
the square of 31. Here 1, 9, and 31 represent the number of pigs
bought and the number of shillings per pig paid by each woman, and 8,
12, and 32 the same in the case of their respective husbands. From the
further information given as to their purchases, we can now pair them
off as follows: Cornelius and Gurtr&uuml;n bought 8 and 1; Elas and Katr&uuml;n
bought 12 and 9; Hendrick and Anna bought 32 and 31. And these pairs
represent correctly the three married couples.</p>

<p>The reader may here desire to know how we may determine the maximum
number of ways in which a number may be expressed as the difference
between two squares, and how we are to find the actual squares. Any
integer except 1, 4, and twice any odd number, may be expressed as the
difference of two integral squares in as many ways as it can be split
up into pairs of factors, counting 1 as a factor. Suppose the number
to be 5,940. The factors are <span class='pagenum'>Pg 168<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>2<sup>2</sup>.3<sup>3</sup>.5.11. Here the exponents are 2,
3, 1, 1. Always deduct 1 from the exponents of 2 and add 1 to all the
other exponents; then we get 1, 4, 2, 2, and half the product of these
four numbers will be the required number of ways in which 5,940 may be
the difference of two squares&mdash;that is, 8. To find these eight
squares, as it is an <i>even</i> number, we first divide by 4 and get 1485,
the eight pairs of factors of which are 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1485, 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;495, 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;297, 9
&times; 165, 11&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;135, 15&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;99, 27&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;55, and 33&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;45. The sum and difference
of any one of these pairs will give the required numbers. Thus, the
square of 1,486 less the square of 1,484 is 5,940, the square of 498
less the square of 492 is the same, and so on. In the case of 63
above, the number is <i>odd</i>; so we factorize at once, 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;63, 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;21, 7
&times; 9. Then we find that <i>half</i> the sum and difference will give us the
numbers 32 and 31, 12 and 9, and 8 and 1, as shown in the solution to
the puzzle.</p>

<p>The reverse problem, to find the factors of a number when you have
expressed it as the difference of two squares, is obvious. For
example, the sum and difference of any pair of numbers in the last
sentence will give us the factors of 63. Every prime number (except 1
and 2) may be expressed as the difference of two squares in one way,
and in one way only. If a number can be expressed as the difference of
two squares in more than one way, it is composite; and having so
expressed it, we may at once obtain the factors, as we have seen.
Fermat showed in a letter to Mersenne or Fr&eacute;nicle, in 1643, how we may
discover whether a number may be expressed as the difference of two
squares in more than one way, or proved to be a prime. But the method,
when dealing with large numbers, is necessarily tedious, though in
practice it may be considerably shortened. In many cases it is the
shortest method known for factorizing large numbers, and I have always
held the opinion that Fermat used it in performing a certain feat in
factorizing that is historical and wrapped in mystery.</p>

<p>The line A B in the following diagram represents the side of a square
having the same area as the cross. I have shown elsewhere, as stated,
how to make a square and equilateral triangle of equal area. I need
not go, therefore, into the preliminary question of finding the
dimensions of the triangle that is to equal our cross. We will assume
that we have already found this, and the question then becomes, How
are we to cut up one of these into pieces that will form the other?</p>

<p>First draw the line A B where A and B are midway between the
extremities of the two side arms. Next make the lines D C and E F
equal in length to half the side of the triangle. Now from E and F
describe with the same radius the intersecting arcs at G and draw F G.
Finally make I K equal to H C and L B equal to A D. If we now draw I
L, it should be parallel to F G, and all the six pieces are marked
out. These fit together and form a perfect equilateral triangle, as
shown in the second diagram. Or we might have first found the
direction of the line M N in our triangle, then placed the point O
over the point E in the cross and turned round the triangle over the
cross until the line M N was parallel to A B. The piece 5 can then be
marked off and the other pieces in succession.</p>

<p>The secret of the bun puzzle lies in the fact that, with the relative
dimensions of the circles as given, the three diameters will form a
right-angled triangle, as shown by A, B, C. It follows that the two
smaller buns are exactly equal to the large bun. Therefore, if we give
David and Edgar the two halves marked D and E, they will have their
fair shares&mdash;one quarter of the confectionery each. Then if we place
the small bun, H, on the top of the remaining one and trace its
circumference in the manner shown, Fred's piece, F, will exactly equal
Harry's small bun, H, with the addition of the piece marked G&mdash;half
the rim of the other. Thus each boy gets an exactly equal share, and

<p>The point was to find a general rule for forming a perfect square out
of another square combined with a "right-angled isosceles triangle."
The triangle to which geometricians give this high-sounding name is,
of course, nothing more or less than half a square that has been
divided from corner to corner.</p>

<p>The precise relative proportions of the square and triangle are of no
consequence whatever. <span class='pagenum'>Pg 172<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>It is only necessary to cut the wood or
material into five pieces.</p>

<p>Suppose our original square to be ACLF in the above diagram and our
triangle to be the shaded portion CED. Now, we first find half the
length of the long side of the triangle (CD) and measure off this
length at AB. Then we place the triangle in its present position
against the square and make two cuts&mdash;one from B to F, and the other
from B to E. Strange as it may seem, that is all that is necessary! If
we now remove the pieces G, H, and M to their new places, as shown in
the diagram, we get the perfect square BEKF.</p>

<p>Take any two square pieces of paper, of different sizes but perfect
squares, and cut the smaller one in half from corner to corner. Now
proceed in the manner shown, and you will find that the two pieces may
be combined to form a larger square by making these two simple cuts,
and that no piece will be required to be turned over.</p>

<p>The remark that the triangle might be "a little larger or a good deal
smaller in proportion" was intended to bar cases where area of
triangle is greater than area of square. In such cases six pieces are
necessary, and if triangle and square are of equal area there is an
obvious solution in three pieces, by simply cutting the square in half
diagonally.</p>

<p>The illustration shows how to cut the four pieces and form with them a
square. First find the side of the square (the mean proportional
between the length and height of the rectangle), and the method is
obvious. If our strip is exactly in the proportions 9x1, or 16x1, or
25x1, we can clearly cut it in 3, 4, or 5 rectangular pieces
respectively to form a square. Excluding these special cases, the
general law is that for a strip in length more than n&sup2; times the
breadth, and not more than (n+1)&sup2; times the breadth, it may be cut in
n+2 pieces to form a square, and there will be n-1 rectangular pieces
like piece 4 in the diagram. Thus, for example, with a strip 24x1, the
length is more than 16 and less than 25 times the breadth. Therefore
it can be done in 6 pieces (n here being 4), 3 of which will be
rectangular. In the case where n equals 1, the rectangle disappears
and we get a solution in three pieces. Within these limits, of course,
the sides need not be rational: the solution is purely geometrical.</p>

<p>As I gave full measurements of the mutilated rug, it was quite an easy
matter to find the precise dimensions for the square. The two pieces
cut off would, if placed together, make an oblong piece 12x6, giving
an area of 72 (inches or yards, as we please), and as the original
complete rug measured 36x27, it had an area of 972. If, therefore, we
deduct the pieces that have been cut away, we find that our new rug
will contain 972 less 72, or 900; and as 900 is the square of 30, we
know that the new rug must measure 30x30 to be a perfect square. This
is a great help towards the solution, because we may safely conclude
that the two horizontal sides measuring 30 each may be left intact.</p>

<p>There is a very easy way of solving the puzzle in four pieces, and
also a way in three pieces that can scarcely be called difficult, but
the correct answer is in only two pieces.</p>

<p>It will be seen that if, after the cuts are made, we insert the teeth
of the piece B one tooth lower down, the two portions will fit
together and form a square.</p>

<p>A regular pentagon may be cut into as few as six pieces that will fit
together without any turning over and form a square, as I shall show
below. Hitherto the best answer has been in seven pieces&mdash;the solution
produced some years ago by a foreign mathematician, Paul Busschop. We
first form a parallelogram, and from that the square. The process will
be seen in the diagram on the next page.</p>

<p>The pentagon is ABCDE. By the cut AC and the cut FM (F being the
middle point between A and C, and M being the same distance from A as
F) we get two pieces that may be placed in position at GHEA and form
the parallelogram GHDC. We then find the mean proportional between the
length HD and the <i>height</i> of the parallelogram. This distance we mark
off from C at K, then draw CK, <span class='pagenum'>Pg 173<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>and from G drop the line GL,
perpendicular to KC. The rest is easy and rather obvious. It will be
seen that the six pieces will form either the pentagon or the square.</p>

<p>I have received what purported to be a solution in five pieces, but
the method was based on the rather subtle fallacy that half the
diagonal plus half the side of a pentagon equals the side of a square
of the same area. I say subtle, because it is an extremely close
approximation that will deceive the eye, and is quite difficult to
prove inexact. I am not aware that attention has before been drawn to
this curious approximation.</p>

or say roughly 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub>. So we can only hope to solve the puzzle by

<p>Diagram A is our original triangle. We will say it measures 5 inches
(or 5 feet) on each side. If we take off a slice at the bottom of any
equilateral triangle by a cut parallel with the base, the portion that
remains will always be an equilateral triangle; so we first cut off
piece 1 and get a triangle 3 inches on every side. The manner of
finding directions of the other cuts in A is obvious from the diagram.</p>

<p>Now, if we want two triangles, 1 will be one of them, and 2, 3, 4, and
5 will fit together, as in B, to form the other. If we want three
equilateral triangles, 1 will be one, 4 and 5 will form the second, as
in C, and 2 and 3 will form the third, as in D. In B and C the piece 5
is turned over; but there can be no objection to this, as it is not
forbidden, and is in no way opposed to the nature of the puzzle.</p>

<p>One object that I had in view when presenting this little puzzle was
to point out the uncertainty of the meaning conveyed by the word
"oval." Though originally derived from the Latin word <i>ovum</i>, an egg,
yet what we understand as the egg-shape (with one end smaller than the
other) is only one of many forms of the oval; while some eggs are
spherical in shape, and a sphere or circle is most certainly not an
oval. If we speak of an ellipse&mdash;a conical ellipse&mdash;we are on safer
ground, but here we must be careful of error. I recollect a Liverpool
town councillor, many years ago, whose ignorance of the poultry-yard
led him to substitute the word "hen" for "fowl," remarking, "We must
remember, gentlemen, that although every cock is a hen, every hen is
not a cock!" Similarly, we must always note that although every
ellipse is an oval, every oval is not an <span class='pagenum'>Pg 174<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>ellipse. It is correct to
say that an oval is an oblong curvilinear figure, having two unequal
diameters, and bounded by a curve line returning into itself; and this
includes the ellipse, but all other figures which in any way approach
towards the form of an oval without necessarily having the properties
above described are included in the term "oval." Thus the following
solution that I give to our puzzle involves the pointed "oval," known
among architects as the "vesica piscis."</p>

pieces form two stools of exactly the same size and shape with similar
hand-holes. These holes are a trifle longer than those in the
schoolmaster's stools, but they are much narrower and of considerably
smaller area. Of course 5 and 6 can be cut out in one piece&mdash;also 7
and 8&mdash;making only <i>six pieces</i> in all. But I wished to keep the same
number as in the original story.</p>

<p>When I first gave the above puzzle in a London newspaper, in

compelled to improvise a pair with the aid of a small penknife, a bit

<p>The areas of circles are to each other as the squares of their
diameters. If you have a circle 2 in. in diameter and another 4 in. in
diameter, then one circle will be four times as great in area as the
other, because the square of 4 is four times as great as the square of
2. Now, if we refer to Diagram 1, we see how two equal squares may be
cut into four pieces that will form one larger square; from which it
is self-evident that any square has just half the area of the square
of its diagonal. In Diagram 2 I have introduced a square as it often
occurs in ancient drawings of the Monad; which was my reason for
believing that the symbol had mathematical meanings, since it will be
found to demonstrate the fact that the area of the outer ring or
annulus is exactly equal to the area of the inner circle. Compare
Diagram 2 with Diagram 1, and you will see that as the square of the
diameter CD is double the square of the diameter of the inner circle,
or CE, therefore the area of the larger circle is double the area of
the smaller one, and consequently the area of the annulus is exactly
equal to that of the inner circle. This answers our first question.</p>

<p>In Diagram 3 I show the simple solution to the second question. It is
obviously correct, and may be proved by the cutting and superposition
of parts. The dotted lines will also serve to make it evident. The
third question is solved by the cut CD in Diagram 2, but it remains to
be proved that the piece F is really one-half of the Yin or the Yan.
This we will <span class='pagenum'>Pg 175<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>do in Diagram 4. The circle K has one-quarter the area
of the circle containing Yin and Yan, because its diameter is just
one-half the length. Also L in Diagram 3 is, we know, one-quarter the
area. It is therefore evident that G is exactly equal to H, and
therefore half G is equal to half H. So that what F loses from L it
gains from K, and F must be half of Yin or Yan.</p>

<p>Any square number may be expressed as the sum of two squares in an
infinite number of different ways. The solution of the present puzzle
forms a simple demonstration of this rule. It is a condition that we
give actual dimensions.</p>

<p>In this puzzle I ignore the known dimensions of our square and work on
the assumption that it is 13n by 13n. The value of n we can afterwards
determine. Divide the square as shown (where the dotted lines indicate
the original markings) into 169 squares. As 169 is the sum of the two
squares 144 and 25, we will proceed to divide the veneer into two
squares, measuring respectively 12x12 and 5x5; and as we know that two
squares may be formed from one square by dissection in four pieces, we
seek a solution in this number. The dark lines in the diagram show
where the cuts are to be made. The square 5x5 is cut out whole, and
the larger square is formed from the remaining three pieces, B, C, and
D, which the reader can easily fit together.</p>

<p>Now, n is clearly <sup>5</sup>/<sub>13</sub> of an inch. Consequently our larger square must
be <sup>60</sup>/<sub>13</sub> in.&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<sup>60</sup>/<sub>13</sub> in., and our smaller square <sup>25</sup>/<sub>13</sub> in.&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>/<sub>13</sub> in.
The square of <sup>60</sup>/<sub>13</sub> added to the square of <sup>25</sup>/<sub>13</sub> is 25. The square is
thus divided into as few as four pieces that form two squares of known
dimensions, and all the sixteen nails are avoided.</p>

<p>Here is a general formula for finding two squares whose sum shall
equal a given square, say a&sup2;. In the case of the solution of our

<p>The puzzle was to cut the two shoes (including the hoof contained
within the outlines) into four pieces, two pieces each, that would fit
together and form a perfect circle. It was also stipulated that all
four pieces should be different in shape. As a matter of fact, it is a
puzzle based on the principle contained in that curious Chinese symbol
the Monad. (See No. <a href="#X_158_THE_GREAT_MONAD">158</a>.)</p>

<p>The above diagrams give the correct solution to the problem. It will
be noticed that 1 and 2 are cut into the required four pieces, all
differ<span class='pagenum'>Pg 176<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>ent in shape, that fit together and form the perfect circle
shown in Diagram 3. It will further be observed that the two pieces A
and B of one shoe and the two pieces C and D of the other form two
exactly similar halves of the circle&mdash;the Yin and the Yan of the great
Monad. It will be seen that the shape of the horseshoe is more easily
determined from the circle than the dimensions of the circle from the
horseshoe, though the latter presents no difficulty when you know that
the curve of the long side of the shoe is part of the circumference of
your circle. The difference between B and D is instructive, and the
idea is useful in all such cases where it is a condition that the
pieces must be different in shape. In forming D we simply add on a
symmetrical piece, a curvilinear square, to the piece B. Therefore, in
giving either B or D a quarter turn before placing in the new
position, a precisely similar effect must be produced.</p>

indicated. Now fold the paper along the lines, and it will have the
appearance shown in Fig. 2. If you want a star like Fig. 3, cut from A
to B; if you wish one like Fig. 4, cut from A to C. Thus, the nearer
you cut to the point at the bottom the longer will be the points of

<p>The reader will probably feel rewarded for any care and patience that
he may bestow on cutting out the cardboard chain. We will suppose that
he has a piece of cardboard measuring 8 in. by 2½ in., though the
dimensions are of no importance. Yet if you want a long chain you must,
of course, take a long strip of cardboard. First rule pencil lines B B
and C C, half an inch from the edges, and also the short perpendicular
lines half an inch apart. Rule lines on the other side in just the same
way, and in order that they shall coincide it is well to prick through
the card with a needle the points where the short lines end. Now take
your penknife and split the card from A A down to B B, and from D D up
to C C. Then cut right through the card along all the short
perpendicular lines, and half through the card along the short portions
of B B and C C that are not dotted. Next turn the card over and cut half
through along the short lines on B B and C C at the places that are
immediately beneath the dotted lines on the upper side. With a little
careful separation of the parts with the penknife, the cardboard may now
be divided into two interlacing ladder-like portions, as shown in Fig.
2; and if you cut away all the shaded parts you will get the chain, cut
solidly out of the cardboard, without any join, as shown in the
illustrations on page 40.</p>

<p>As many as twenty-two pieces may be obtained by the six cuts. The
illustration shows a pretty symmetrical solution. The rule in such
cases is that every cut shall intersect every other cut and no two
intersections coincide; that is to say, every line passes through
every other line, but more than two lines do not cross at the same
point anywhere. There are other ways of making the cuts, but this rule
must always be observed if we are to get the full number of pieces.</p>

<p>The general formula is that with <i>n</i> cuts we can always produce <sup>(<i>n</i>(<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sup>/<sub>2</sub> . One of the problems proposed by the late Sam Loyd
was to produce the maximum number of pieces by <i>n</i> straight cuts
through a solid cheese. Of course, again, the pieces cut off may not
be moved or piled. Here we have to deal with the intersection of
planes (instead of lines), and the general formula is that with <i>n</i>
cuts we may produce <sup>((<i>n</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1)<i>n</i>(<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1))</sup>/<sub>6</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 pieces.
It is extremely difficult to "see" the direction and effects of the
successive cuts for more than a few of the lowest values of <i>n</i>.</p>

<p>So far as I have been able to discover, there is only one possible
solution to fulfil the conditions. The pieces fit together as in
Diagram 1, Diagrams 2 and 3 showing how the two original squares are
to be cut. It will be seen that the pieces A and C have each twenty
chequers, and are therefore of equal area. Diagram 4 (built up with
the dissected square No. 5) solves the puzzle, except for the small
condition contained in the words, "I cut the <i>two</i> squares in the
manner desired." In this case the smaller square is preserved intact.
Still I give it as an illustration of a feature of the puzzle. It is
impossible in a problem of this kind to give a <i>quarter-turn</i> to any
of the pieces if the pattern is to properly match, but (as in the case
of F, in Diagram 4) we may give a symmetrical piece a
<i>half-turn</i>&mdash;that is, turn it upside down. Whether or not a piece may
be given a quarter-turn, a half-turn, or no turn at all in these
chequered problems, depends on the character of the design, on the
material employed, and also on the form of the piece itself.</p>

kept apart, or two adjoining portions might be held to be one piece,
in which case the condition as to shape would have to be broken. At
present there is only one shape for each piece of land&mdash;half a square
divided diagonally. And A, B, C, and D can each reach their land from
the outside, and have each equal access to the well in the centre.</p>

<p>The triangular piece of land that was not for sale contains exactly
eleven acres. Of course it is not difficult to find the answer if we
follow the eccentric and tricky tracks of intricate trigonometry; or I
might say that the application of a well-known formula reduces the
problem to finding one-quarter of the square root of (4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;370&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;116) -
(370&nbsp;+&nbsp;116&nbsp;-&nbsp;74)&sup2;&mdash;that is a quarter of the square root of 1936, which
is one-quarter of 44, or 11 acres. But all that the reader really
requires to know is the Pythagorean law on which many puzzles have
been built, that in any right-angled triangle the square of the
hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
I shall dispense with all "surds" and similar absurdities,
notwithstanding the fact that the sides of our triangle are clearly
incommensurate, since we cannot exactly extract the square roots of
the three square areas.</p>

<p>In the above diagram ABC represents our triangle. ADB is a
right-angled triangle, AD measuring 9 and BD measuring 17, because the
square of 9 added to the square of 17 equals 370, the known area of
the square on AB. Also AEC is a right-angled triangle, and the square
of 5 added to the square of 7 equals 74, the square estate on A C.
Similarly, CFB is a right-angled triangle, for the square of 4 added
to the square of 10 equals 116, the square estate on BC. Now, although
the sides of our triangular estate are incommensurate, we have in this
diagram all the exact figures that we need to discover the area with
precision.</p>

<p>The area of our triangle ADB is clearly half of 9&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;17, or 76&frac12; acres.
The area of AEC is half of 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;7, or 17&frac12; acres; the area of CFB is
half of 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10, or 20 acres; and the area of the oblong EDFC is
obviously 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;7, or 28 acres. Now, if we add together 17&frac12;, 20, and <span class='pagenum'>Pg 184<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span>28
= 65&frac12;, and deduct this sum from the area of the large triangle ADB

<p>The area of the complete estate is exactly one hundred acres. To find

<p>where a, b, c represent the three square areas, in any order. The
expression gives the area of the triangle A. This will be found to be
9 acres. It can be easily proved that A, B, C, and D are all equal in
area; so the answer is 26&nbsp;+&nbsp;20&nbsp;+&nbsp;18&nbsp;+&nbsp;9&nbsp;+&nbsp;9&nbsp;+&nbsp;9&nbsp;+&nbsp;9&nbsp;=&nbsp;100 acres.</p>

<img src="images/a190.png" width="400" height="396" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Here is the proof. If every little dotted square in the diagram
represents an acre, this must be a correct plan of the estate, for the
squares of 5 and 1 together equal 26; the squares of 4 and 2 equal 20;
and the squares of 3 and 3 added together equal 18. Now we see at once
that the area of the triangle E is 2&frac12;, F is 4&frac12;, and G is 4. These
added together make 11 acres, which we deduct from the area of the
rectangle, 20 acres, and we find that the field A contains exactly 9
acres. If you want to prove that B, C, and D are equal in size to A,
divide them in two by a line from the middle of the longest side to
the opposite angle, and you will find that the two pieces in every
case, if cut out, will exactly fit together and form A.</p>

<p>Or we can get our proof in a still easier way. The complete area of
the squared diagram is 12&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;12&nbsp;=&nbsp;144 acres, and the portions 1, 2, 3,
4, not included in the estate, have the respective areas of 12&frac12;, 17&frac12;,
9&frac12;, and 4&frac12;. These added together make 44, which, deducted from 144,
leaves 100 as the required area of the complete estate.</p>

<p>This is the answer that is always given and accepted as correct: Two
more hurdles would be necessary, for the pen was twenty-four by one
(as in Fig. A on next page), and by moving one of the sides and
placing an extra hurdle at each end (as in Fig. B) the area would be
doubled. The diagrams are not to scale. Now there is no condition in
the puzzle that requires the sheep-fold to be of any particular form.
But even if we accept the point that the pen was twenty-four by one,
the answer utterly fails, for two extra hurdles are certainly not at
all necessary. For example, I arrange the fifty hurdles as in Fig. C,
and as the area is increased from twenty-four "square hurdles" to 156,
there is now accommodation for 650 sheep. If it be held that the area
must be exactly double that of the original pen, then I construct it
(as in Fig. D) with twenty-eight hurdles only, and have twenty-two in
hand for other purposes on the farm. Even if it were insisted that all
the original hurdles must be used, then I should construct it as in
Fig. E, where I can get the area as exact as any farmer could possibly
require, even if we have to allow for the fact that the sheep might
not be able to graze at the extreme ends. Thus we see that, from any
<span class='pagenum'>Pg 185<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>point of view, the accepted answer to this ancient little puzzle
breaks down. And yet attention has never before been drawn to the
absurdity.</p>

<p>The puzzle was to divide the circular field into four equal parts by
three walls, each wall being of exactly the same length. There are two
essential difficulties in this problem. These are: (1) the thickness
of the walls, and (2) the condition that these walls are three in
number. As to the first point, since we are told that the walls are
brick walls, we clearly cannot ignore their thickness, while we have
to find a solution that will equally work, whether the walls be of a
thickness of one, two, three, or more bricks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/a194.png" width="400" height="412" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The second point requires a little more consideration. How are we to
distinguish between a wall and walls? A straight wall without any bend
in it, no matter how long, cannot ever become "walls," if it is
neither broken nor intersected in any way. Also our circular field is
clearly enclosed by one wall. But if it had happened to be a square or
a triangular enclosure, would there be respectively four and three
walls or only one enclosing wall in each case? It is true that we
speak of "the four walls" of a square building or garden, but this is
only a conventional way of saying "the four sides." If you were
speaking of the actual brickwork, you would say, "I am going to
enclose this square garden with a wall." Angles clearly do not affect
the question, for we may have a zigzag wall just as well as a straight
one, and the Great Wall of China is a good example of a wall with
plenty of angles. Now, if you look at Diagrams 1, 2, and 3, you may be
puzzled to declare whether there are in each case two or four new
walls; but you cannot call them three, as required in our puzzle. The
intersection either affects the question or it does not affect it.</p>

<p>If you tie two pieces of string firmly together, or splice them in a
nautical manner, they become "one piece of string." If you simply let
them lie across one another or overlap, they remain "two pieces of
string." It is all a question of joining and welding. It may similarly
be held that if two walls be built into one another&mdash;I might almost
say, if they be made homogeneous&mdash;they become one wall, in which case
Diagrams 1, 2, and 3 might each be said to show one wall or two, if it
be indicated that the four ends only touch, and are not really built
into, the outer circular wall.</p>

<p>The objection to Diagram 4 is that although it shows the three
required walls (assuming the ends are not built into the outer
circular wall), yet it is only absolutely correct when we assume the
walls to have no thickness. A brick has thickness, and therefore the
fact throws the whole method out and renders it only approximately
correct.</p>

<p>Diagram 5 shows, perhaps, the only correct and perfectly satisfactory
solution. It will be noticed that, in addition to the circular wall,
there are three new walls, which touch (and so enclose) but are not
built into one another. This solution may be adapted to any desired
thickness of wall, and its correctness as to area and length of wall
space is so obvious that it is unnecessary to explain it. I will,
however, just say that the semicircular piece of ground that each
tenant gives to his neighbour is exactly equal to the semicircular
piece that his neighbour gives to him, while any section of wall space
found in one garden is precisely repeated in all the others. Of course
there is an infinite number of ways in which this solution may be
correctly varied.</p>

one-fourth of the side AD Now, if she makes EG equal to AF, and GH
equal to EF, then AH is the required width for the path in order that
the bed shall be exactly half the area of the garden. An exact
numerical measurement can only be obtained when the sum of the squares
of the two sides is a square number. Thus, if the garden measured 12
poles by 5 poles (where the squares of 12 and 5, 144 and 25, sum to
169, the square of 13), then 12 added to 5, less 13, would equal four,

<p>This problem is quite simple if properly attacked. Let us suppose the
triangle ABC to represent our half-acre field, and the shaded portion
to be the quarter-acre over which the goat will graze when tethered to
the corner C. Now, as six equal equilateral triangles placed together
will form a regular hexagon, as shown, it is evident that the shaded
pasture is just one-sixth of the complete area of a circle. Therefore
all we require is the radius (CD) of a circle containing six
quarter-acres or 1½ acres, which is equal to 9,408,960 square
inches. As we only want our answer "to the nearest inch," it is
sufficiently exact for our purpose if we assume that as 1 is to
3.1416, so is the diameter of a circle to its circumference. If,
therefore, we divide the last number I gave by 3.1416, and extract the
square root, we find that 1,731 inches, or 48 yards 3 inches, is the
required length of the tether "to the nearest inch."</p>

<p>I will put the young geometer in the way of a rigid proof. First prove
that twice the square of the line AB equals the square of the distance
BG, from which it follows that HABN are the four corners of a square.
To prove that I is the centre of this square, draw a line from H to P
through QIB and continue the arc HK to P. Then, conceiving the
necessary lines to be drawn, the angle HKP, being in a semicircle, is
a right angle. Let fall the perpendicular KQ, and by similar
triangles, and from the fact that HKI is an isosceles triangle by the
construction, it can be proved that HI is half of HB. We can similarly
prove that C is the centre of the square of which AIB are three
corners.</p>

the table." Now, if a ladder be <span class='pagenum'>Pg 187<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span>placed against a wall with only one
end on the ground, it can hardly be said that it is "laid on the
ground." And if we place the sticks in the above manner, it is only
possible to make one end of two of them touch the table: to say that
every one lies on the table would not be correct. To obtain a solution
it is only necessary to have our sticks of proper dimensions. Say the
long sticks are each 2 ft. in length and the short ones 1 ft. Then the
sticks must be 3 in. thick, when the three equal squares may be
enclosed, as shown in the second diagram. If I had said "matches"
instead of "sticks," the puzzle would be impossible, because an
ordinary match is about twenty-one times as long as it is broad, and
the enclosed rectangles would not be squares.</p>

<p>I have found that a large number of people imagine that the following
is a correct solution of the problem. Using the letters in the diagram
below, they argue that if you make the distance BA one-third of BC,
and therefore the area of the rectangle ABE equal to that of the
triangular remainder, the card must hang with the long side
horizontal. Readers will remember the jest of Charles II., who induced
the Royal Society to meet and discuss the reason why the water in a
vessel will not rise if you put a live fish in it; but in the middle
of the proceedings one of the least distinguished among them quietly
slipped out and made the experiment, when he found that the water
<i>did</i> rise! If my correspondents had similarly made the experiment
with a piece of cardboard, they would have found at once their error.
Area is one thing, but gravitation is quite another. The fact of that
triangle sticking its leg out to D has to be compensated for by
additional area in the rectangle. As a matter of fact, the ratio of BA
to AC is as 1 is to the square root of 3, which latter cannot be given
in an exact numerical measure, but is approximately 1.732. Now let us
look at the correct general solution. There are many ways of arriving
at the desired result, but the one I give is, I think, the simplest
for beginners.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/a199.png" width="400" height="342" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Fix your card on a piece of paper and draw the equilateral triangle
BCF, BF and CF being equal to BC. Also mark off the point G so that DG
shall equal DC. Draw the line CG and produce it until it cuts the line
BF in H. If we now make HA parallel to BE, then A is the point from
which our cut must be made to the corner D, as indicated by the dotted
line.</p>

<p>A curious point in connection with this problem is the fact that the
position of the point A is independent of the side CD. The reason for
this is more obvious in the solution I have given than in any other
method that I have seen, and (although the problem may be solved with
all the working on the cardboard) that is partly why I have preferred
it. It will be seen at once that however much you may reduce the width
of the card by bringing E nearer to B and D nearer to C, the line CG,
being the diagonal of a square, will always lie in the same direction,
and will cut BF in H. Finally, if you wish to get an approximate
measure for the distance BA, all you have to do is to multiply the
length of the card by the decimal .366. Thus, if the card were 7
inches long, we get 7&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;.366&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.562, or a little more than 2&frac12; inches, for
the distance from B to A.</p>

<p>But the real joke of the puzzle is this: We have seen that the
position of the point A is independent of the width of the card, and
depends entirely on the length. Now, in the illustration it will be
found that both cards have the same length; consequently all the
little maid had to do was to lay the clipped card on top of the other
one and mark off the point A at precisely the same distance from the
top left-hand corner! So, after all, Pappus' puzzle, as he presented
it to his little maid, was quite an infantile problem, when he was
able to show her how to perform the feat without first introducing her
to the elements of statics and geometry.</p>

<p>Solvers of this little puzzle, I have generally found, may be roughly
divided into two classes: those who get within a mile of the correct
answer by means of more or less complex calcu<span class='pagenum'>Pg 188<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>lations, involving
"<i>pi</i>," and those whose arithmetical kites fly hundreds and thousands
of miles away from the truth. The comparatively easy method that I
shall show does not involve any consideration of the ratio that the
diameter of a circle bears to its circumference. I call it the
"hat-box method."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/a200.png" width="400" height="469" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Supposing we place our ball of wire, A, in a cylindrical hat-box, B,
that exactly fits it, so that it touches the side all round and
exactly touches the top and bottom, as shown in the illustration.
Then, by an invariable law that should be known by everybody, that box
contains exactly half as much again as the ball. Therefore, as the
ball is 24 in. in diameter, a hat-box of the same circumference but
two-thirds of the height (that is, 16 in. high) will have exactly the
same contents as the ball.</p>

<p>Now let us consider that this reduced hat-box is a cylinder of metal
made up of an immense number of little wire cylinders close together
like the hairs in a painter's brush. By the conditions of the puzzle
we are allowed to consider that there are no spaces between the wires.
How many of these cylinders one one-hundredth of an inch thick are
equal to the large cylinder, which is 24 in. thick? Circles are to one
another as the squares of their diameters. The square of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub> is
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>100000</sub>, and the square of 24 is 576; therefore the large cylinder
contains 5,760,000 of the little wire cylinders. But we have seen that
each of these wires is 16 in. long; hence 16&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5,760,000 = 92,160,000
inches as the complete length of the wire. Reduce this to miles, and
we get 1,454 miles 2,880 ft. as the length of the wire attached to the
professor's kite.</p>

<p>Whether a kite would fly at such a height, or support such a weight,
are questions that do not enter into the problem.</p>

were 8 ft. by 3 ft., and the above rule gives 8 in. as the side of the
square pieces that have to be cut away. Of course it will not always
come out exact, as in this case (on account of that square root), but
you can get as near as you like with decimals.</p>

<p>If you mark a point A on the circumference of a wheel that runs on the
surface of a level road, like an ordinary cart-wheel, the curve
described by that point will be a common cycloid, as in Fig. 1. But if
you mark a point B on the circumference of the flange of a
locomotive-wheel, the curve will be a curtate cycloid, as in Fig. 2,
terminating in nodes. Now, if we consider one of these nodes or loops,
we shall see that "at any given moment" certain points at the bottom
of the loop must be moving in the opposite direction to the train. As
there is an infinite number of such points on the flange's
circumference, there must be an infinite number of these loops being
described while the train is in motion. In fact, at any given moment
certain points on the flanges are always moving in a direction
opposite to that in which the train is going.</p>

<p>In the case of the two wheels, the wheel that runs round the
stationary one makes two revolutions round its own centre. As both
wheels are of the same size, it is obvious that if at the start we
mark a point on the circumference of the upper wheel, at the very top,
this point will be in contact with the lower wheel at its lowest part
when half the journey has been made. Therefore this point is again at
the top of the moving wheel, and one revolution has been made.
Consequently there are two such revolutions in the complete journey.</p>

similar triangles, one figure is three times as large as the other,

<p>As all the points and lines puzzles that I have given so far,
excepting the last, are variations of the case of ten points arranged
to form five lines of four, it will be well to consider this
particular case generally. There are six fundamental solutions, and no
more, as shown in the six diagrams. These, for the sake of
convenience, I named some years ago the Star, the Dart, the Compasses,
the Funnel, the Scissors, and the Nail. (See next page.) Readers will
understand that any one of these forms may be distorted in an infinite
number of different ways without destroying its real character.</p>

<p>In "The King and the Castles" we have the Star, and its solution gives
the Compasses. In the "Cherries and Plums" solution we find that the
Cherries represent the Funnel and the Plums the Dart. The solution of
the "Plantation Puzzle" is an example of the Dart distorted. Any
solution to the "Ten Coins" will represent the Scissors. Thus examples
of all have been given except the Nail.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 191<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p>On a reduced chessboard, 7 by 7, we may place the ten pawns in just
three different ways, but they must all represent the Dart. The
"Plantation" shows one way, the Plums show a second way, and the
reader may like to find the third way for himself. On an ordinary
chessboard, 8 by 8, we can also get in a beautiful example of the
Funnel&mdash;symmetrical in relation to the diagonal of the board. The
smallest board that will take a Star is one 9 by 7. The Nail requires
a board 11 by 7, the Scissors 11 by 9, and the Compasses 17 by 12. At least these are the best
results recorded in my note-book. They may be beaten, but I do not
think so. If you divide a chessboard into two parts by a diagonal
zigzag line, so that the larger part contains 36 squares and the
smaller part 28 squares, you can place three separate schemes on the
larger part and one on the smaller part (all Darts) without their
conflicting&mdash;that is, they occupy forty different squares. They can be
placed in other ways without a division of the board. The smallest
square board that will contain six different schemes (not
fundamentally different), without any line of one scheme crossing the
line of another, is 14 by 14; and the smallest board that will contain
one scheme entirely enclosed within the lines of a second scheme,
without any of the lines of the one, when drawn from point to point,
crossing a line of the other, is 14 by 12.</p>

<p>The main point is to discover the smallest possible number of Russians
that there could have been. As the enemy opened fire from all
directions, it is clearly necessary to find what is the smallest
number of heads that could form sixteen lines with three heads in
every line. Note that I say sixteen, and not thirty-two, because every
line taken by a bullet may be also taken by another bullet fired in
exactly the opposite direction. Now, as few as eleven points, or
heads, may be arranged to form the required sixteen lines of three,
but the discovery of this arrangement is a hard nut. The diagram<span class='pagenum'>Pg 192<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span>
at the foot of this page will show exactly how the thing is to be
done.</p>

<p>If, therefore, eleven Russians were in the positions shown by the
stars, and the thirty-two Turks in the positions indicated by the
black dots, it will be seen, by the lines shown, that each Turk may
fire exactly over the heads of three Russians. But as each bullet
kills a man, it is essential that every Turk shall shoot one of his
comrades and be shot by him in turn; otherwise we should have to
provide extra Russians to be shot, which would be destructive of the
correct solution of our problem. As the firing was simultaneous, this
point presents no difficulties. The answer we thus see is that there
were at least eleven Russians amongst whom there was no casualty, and
that all the thirty-two Turks were shot by one another. It was not
stated whether the Russians fired any shots, but it will be evident
that even if they did their firing could not have been effective: for
if one of their bullets killed a Turk, then we have immediately to
provide another man for one of the Turkish bullets to kill; and as the
Turks were known to be thirty-two in number, this <span class='pagenum'>Pg 193<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>would necessitate
our introducing another Russian soldier and, of course, destroying the
solution. I repeat that the difficulty of the puzzle consists in
finding how to arrange eleven points so that they shall form sixteen
lines of three. I am told that the possibility of doing this was first
discovered by the Rev. Mr. Wilkinson some twenty years ago.</p>

be leaps and 2<i>n</i>-4 simple moves.</p>

<p>In the even cases write, for the moves, all the even numbers in

must be repeated &frac12;<i>n</i> times and followed by the even numbers in

<p>Move the counters in the following order. The moves in brackets are to
be made four times in succession. 12, 1, 3, 2, 12, 11, 1, 3, 2 (5, 7,
9, 10, 8, 6, 4), 3, 2, 12, 11, 2, 1, 2. The grasshoppers will then be
reversed in forty-four moves.</p>

<p>The general solution of this problem is very difficult. Of course it
can always be solved by the method given in the solution of the last
puzzle, if we have no desire to use the fewest possible moves. But to
employ a full economy of moves we have two main points to consider.
There are always what I call a lower movement (L) and an upper
movement (U). L consists in exchanging certain of the highest numbers,
such as 12, 11, 10 in our "Grasshopper Puzzle," with certain of the
lower numbers, 1, 2, 3; the former moving in a clockwise direction,
the latter in a non-clockwise direction. U consists in reversing the
intermediate counters. In the above solution for 12, it will be seen
that 12, 11, and 1, 2, 3 are engaged in the L movement, and 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10 in the U movement. The L movement needs 16 moves and U 28,
making together 44. We might also involve 10 in the L movement, which
would result in L 23, U 21, making also together 44 moves. These I
call the first and second methods. But any other scheme will entail an
increase of moves. You always get these two methods (of equal economy)
for odd or even counters, but the point is to determine just how many
to involve in L and how many in U. Here is the solution in table form.
But first note, in giving values to <i>n</i>, that 2, 3, and 4 counters are
special cases, requiring respectively 3, 3, and 6 moves, and that 5
and 6 counters do not give a minimum solution by the second
method&mdash;only by the first.</p>

<p>In solving this puzzle there were two things to be achieved: first, so
to manipulate the counters that the word VICTORIA should read round
the cross in the same direction, only with the V on one of the dark
arms; and secondly, to perform the feat in the fewest possible moves.
Now, as a matter of fact, it would be impossible to perform the first
part in any way whatever if all the letters of the word were
different; but as there are two I's, it can be done by making these
letters change places&mdash;that is, the first I changes from the 2nd place
to the 7th, and the second I from the 7th place to the 2nd. But the
point I referred to, when introducing the puzzle, as a little
remarkable is this: that a solution in twenty-two moves is obtainable
by moving the letters in the order of the following words: "A VICTOR!
A VICTOR! A VICTOR I!"</p>

<p>There are, however, just six solutions in eighteen moves, and the
following is one of them: I (1), V, A, I (2), R, O, T, I (1), I (2),
A, V, I (2), I (1), C, I (2), V, A, I (1). The first and second I in
the word are distinguished by the numbers 1 and 2.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that in the first solution given above one of the
I's never moves, though the movements of the other letters cause it to
change its relative position. There is another peculiarity I may point
out&mdash;that there is a solution in twenty-eight moves requiring no
letter to move to the central division except the I's. I may also
mention that, in each of the solutions in eighteen moves, the letters
C, T, O, R move once only, while the second I always moves four times,
the V always being transferred to the right arm of the cross.</p>

<p>In order to place words round the circle under the conditions, it is
necessary to select words in which letters are repeated in certain
relative positions. Thus, the word that solves our puzzle is
"Swansea," in which the first and fifth letters are the same, and the
third and seventh the same. We make out jumps as follows, taking the
letters of the word in their proper order: 2-5, 7-2, 4-7, 1-4, 6-1,
3-6, 8-3. Or we could place a word like "Tarapur" (in which the second
and fourth letters, and the third and seventh, are alike) with these
moves: 6-1, 7-4, 2-7, 5-2, 8-5, 3-6, 8-3. But "Swansea" is the only
word, apparently, that will fulfil the conditions of the puzzle.</p>

<p>This puzzle should be compared with Sharp's Puzzle, referred to in my

over two" is identical with "touch and move along a line."</p>

except one, which is left in the central hole. The solution needs
judgment, as one is tempted to make several jumps in one move, where
it would be the reverse of good play. For example, after playing the
first 3-11 above, one is inclined to increase the length of the move
by continuing with 11-25, 25-27, or with 11-9, 9-7.</p>

<p>In order that the cat should eat every thirteenth mouse, and the white
mouse last of all, it is necessary that the count should begin at the
seventh mouse (calling the white one the first)&mdash;that is, at the one
nearest the tip of the cat's tail. In this case it is not at all
necessary to try starting at all the mice in turn until you come to
the right one, for you can just start anywhere and note how far
distant the last one eaten is from the starting point. You will find
it to be the eighth, and therefore must start at the eighth, counting
backwards from the white mouse. This is the one I have indicated.</p>

<p>In the case of the second puzzle, where you have to find the smallest
number with which the cat may start at the white mouse and eat this
one last of all, unless you have mastered the general solution of the
problem, which is very difficult, there is no better course open to
you than to try every number in succession until you come to one that
works correctly. The smallest number is twenty-one. If you have to
proceed by trial, you will shorten your labour a great deal by only
counting out the remainders when the number is divided successively by
13, 12, 11, 10, etc. Thus, in the case of 21, we have the remainders
8, 9, 10, 1, 3, 5, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1. Note that I do not give the
remainders of 7, 3, and 1 as nought, but as 7, 3, and 1. Now, count
round each of these numbers in turn, and you will find that the white
mouse is killed last of all. Of course, if we wanted simply any
number, not the smallest, the solution is very easy, for we merely
take the least common multiple of 13, 12, 11, 10, etc. down to 2. This
is 360360, and you will find that the first count kills the thirteenth
mouse, the next the twelfth, the next the eleventh, and so on down to
the first. But the most arithmetically inclined cat could not be
expected to take such a big number when a small one like twenty-one
would equally serve its purpose.</p>

<p>In the third case, the smallest number is 100. The number 1,000 would
also do, and there are just seventy-two other numbers between these
that the cat might employ with equal success.</p>

I-D, K-L, G-J, J-A, F-K, L-E, D-K, E-F, E-D, E-B, B-K. It will be
found that, although the white counters can be moved to their proper
places in 11 moves, if we omit all consideration of exchanges, yet the
black cannot be so moved in fewer than 17 moves. So we have to
introduce waste moves with the white counters to equal the minimum
required by the black. Thus fewer than 17 moves must be impossible.

give my solution in that form. The silk hats are represented by black
counters and the felt hats by white counters. The first row shows the
hats in their original positions, and then each succes<span class='pagenum'>Pg 197<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>sive row shows
how they appear after one of the five manipulations. It will thus be
seen that we first move hats 2 and 3, then 7 and 8, then 4 and 5, then
10 and 11, and, finally, 1 and 2, leaving the four silk hats together,
the four felt hats together, and the two vacant pegs at one end of the

pairs being similar. There are other ways of solving the puzzle.</p>

for some catch or quibble in the statement of what we are asked to do.

between the fold, you can with one stroke make the two lines CD and EF
in our diagram. Then start at A, and describe the line ending at B.
Finally put in the last line GH, and the thing is done strictly within

There is a rule that tells us that in the case of a drawing like the
present one, where there are sixteen odd nodes, it requires eight
separate strokes or routes (that is, half as many as there are odd
nodes) to complete it. As we have to produce as much as possible with
only one of these eight strokes, it is clearly necessary to contrive
that the seven strokes from odd node to odd node shall be as short as

<p>Note that there are six towns, from which only two roads issue. Thus 1
must lie between 9 and 12 in the circular route. Mark these two roads
as settled. Similarly mark 9, 5, 14, and 4, 8, 14, and 10, 6, 15, and
10, 2, 13, and 3, 7, 13. All these roads must be taken. Then you will
find that he must go from 4 to 15, as 13 is closed, and that he is
compelled to take 3, 11, 16, and also 16, 12. Thus, there is only one
route, as follows: 1, 9, 5, 14, 8, 4, 15, 6, 10, 2, 13, 7, 3, 11, 16,

<p>Though we cannot really see all the sides of the octahedron at once,
we can make a projection of it that suits our purpose just as well. In
the diagram the six points represent the six angles of the octahedron,
and four lines proceed from every point under exactly the same
conditions as the twelve edges of the solid. Therefore if we start at
the point A and go over all the lines once, we must always end our
route at A. And the number of different routes is just 1,488, counting
the reverse way of any route as different. It would take too much
space to show how I make the count. It can be done in about five
minutes, but an explanation of the method is difficult. The reader is
therefore asked to accept my answer as correct.</p>

<p>There are thirty edges, of which eighteen were visible in the original
illustration, represented <span class='pagenum'>Pg 199<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>in the following diagram by the hexagon
NAESGD. By this projection of the solid we get an imaginary view of
the remaining twelve edges, and are able to see at once their
direction and the twelve points at which all the edges meet. The
difference in the length of the lines is of no importance; all we want
is to present their direction in a graphic manner. But in case the
novice should be puzzled at only finding nineteen triangles instead of
the required twenty, I will point out that the apparently missing
triangle is the outline HIK.</p>

<p>In this case there are twelve odd nodes; therefore six distinct and
disconnected routes will be needful if we are not to go over any lines
twice. Let us therefore find the greatest distance that we may so
travel in one route.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that I have struck out with little cross strokes
five lines or edges in the diagram. These five lines may be struck out
anywhere so long as they do not join one another, and so long as one
of them does not connect with N, the North Pole, from which we are to
start. It will be seen that the result of striking out these five
lines is that all the nodes are now even except N and S. Consequently
if we begin at N and stop at S we may go over all the lines, except
the five crossed out, without traversing any line twice. There are
many ways of doing this. Here is one route: N to H, I, K, S, I, E, S,
G, K, D, H, A, N, B, A, E, F, B, C, G, D, N, C, F, S. By thus making
five of the routes as short as is possible&mdash;simply from one node to
the next&mdash;we are able to get the greatest possible length for our
sixth line. A greater distance in one route, without going over the
same ground twice, it is not possible to get.</p>

<p>It is now readily seen that those five erased lines must be gone over
twice, and they may be "picked up," so to speak, at any points of our
route. Thus, whenever the traveller happens to be at I he can run up
to A and back before proceeding on his route, or he may wait until he
is at A and then run down to I and back to A. And so with the other
lines that have to be traced twice. It is, therefore, clear that he
can go over 25 of the lines once only (25&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10,000 miles&nbsp;=&nbsp;250,000
miles) and 5 of the lines twice (5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;20,000 miles&nbsp;=&nbsp;100,000 miles), the
total, 350,000 miles, being the length of his travels and the shortest
distance that is possible in visiting the whole body.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that I have made him end his travels at S, the
South Pole, but this is not imperative. I might have made him finish
at any of the other nodes, except the one from which he started.
Suppose it had been required to bring him home again to N at the end
of his travels. Then instead of suppressing the line AI we might leave
that open and close IS. This would enable him to complete his 350,000
miles tour at A, and another 10,000 miles would take him to his own
fireside. There are a great many different routes, but as the lengths
of the edges are all alike, one course is as good as another. To make
the complete 350,000 miles tour from N to S absolutely clear to
everybody, I will give it entire: N to H, I, A, I, K, H, K, S, I, E,
S, G, F, G, K, D, C, D, H, A, N, B, E, B, A, E, F, B, C, G, D, N, C,
F, S&mdash;that is, thirty-five lines of 10,000 miles each.</p>

<p>Starting from A, the inspector need only travel 36 furlongs if he
takes the following route: A to B, G, H, C, D, I, H, M, N, I, J, O, N,
S, R, M, L, G, F, K, L, Q, R, S, T, O, J, E, D, C, B, A, F, K, P, Q.
He thus passes between A and B twice, between C and D twice, between F
and K twice, between J and O twice, and between R and S twice&mdash;five
repetitions. Therefore 31 passages plus 5 repeated equal 36 furlongs.
The little pitfall in this puzzle lies in the fact that we start from
an even node. Otherwise we need only travel 35 furlongs.</p>

island (counting A as 1); by the second route he will make C his 13th

his 17th island. If he goes the reverse way, C will be respectively
his 10th, 9th, 6th, and 5th island. As these are the only possible
routes, it is evident that if the sailor puts off his visit to C as
long as possible, he must take the last route reading from left to
right. This route I show by the dark lines in the diagram, and it is
the correct answer to the puzzle.</p>

<p>The first thing to do in trying to solve a puzzle like this is to
attempt to simplify it. If you look at Fig. 1, you will see that it is
a simplified version of the map. Imagine the circular towns to be
buttons and the railways to be connecting strings. (See solution to
<a href="#X_341_THE_FOUR_FROGSa">No. 341.</a>) Then, it will be seen, we have simply "straightened out" the
previous diagram without affecting the conditions. Now we can further
simplify by converting Fig. 1 into Fig. 2, which is a portion of a
chessboard. Here the directions of the railways will resemble the
moves of a rook in chess&mdash;that is, we may move in any direction
parallel to the sides of the diagram, but not diagonally. Therefore
the first town (or square) visited must be a black one; the second
must be a white; the third must be a black; and so on. Every odd
square visited will thus be black and every even one white. Now, we
have 23 squares to visit (an odd number), so the last square visited
must be black. But Z happens to be white, so the puzzle would seem to
be impossible of solution.</p>

<p>As we were told that the man "succeeded" in carrying put his plan, we
must try to find some loophole in the conditions. He was to "enter
every town once and only once," and we find no prohibition against his
entering once the town A after leaving it, especially as he has never
left it since he was born, and would thus be "entering" it for the
first time in his life. But he must return at once from the first town
he visits, and then he will have only 22 towns to visit, and as 22 is
an even number, there is no reason why he should not end on the white
square Z. A possible route for him is indicated by the dotted line
from A to Z. This route is repeated by the dark lines in Fig. 1, and
the reader will now have no difficulty in applying; it to the original
map. We have thus proved that the puzzle can only be solved by a
return to A immediately after leaving it.</p>

<p>The simplest way is to write in the number of routes to all the towns
in this manner. Put a 1 on all the towns in the top row and in the
first column. Then the number of routes to any town will be the sum of
the routes to the town immediately above and to the town immediately
to the left. Thus the routes in the second row will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, etc., in the third row, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, etc.; and so on with
the other rows. It will then be seen that the only town to which there
are exactly 1,365 different routes is the twelfth town in the fifth
row&mdash;the one immediately over the letter E. This town was therefore
the cyclist's destination.</p>

<p>The general formula for the number of routes from one corner to the
corner diagonally opposite on any such rectangular reticulated
arrangement, under the conditions as to direction, is <sup>(<i>m</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>n</i>)!</sup>/<sub><i>m</i>!<i>n</i>!</sub>,
where m is the number of towns on one side, less one, and n the number
on the other side, less one. Our solution involves the case where
there are 12 towns by 5. Therefore <i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;11 and <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4. Then the formula
gives us the answer 1,365 as above.</p>

<p>First of all I will ask the reader to compare the original square
diagram with the circular one shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 below. If for
the moment we ignore the shading (the purpose of which I shall proceed
to explain), we find that the circular diagram in each case is merely
a simplification of the original square one&mdash;that is, the roads from A
lead to B, E, and M in both cases, the roads from L (London) lead to
I, K, and S, and so on. The form below, being circular and
symmetrical, answers my purpose better in applying a mechanical
solution, and I therefore adopt it without altering in any way the
conditions of the puzzle. If such a question as distances from town to
town came into the problem, the new diagrams might require the
addition of numbers to indicate these distances, or they might
conceivably not be at all practicable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/a254.png" width="600" height="221" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now, I draw the three circular diagrams, as shown, on a sheet of paper
and then cut out three pieces of cardboard of the forms indicated by
the shaded parts of these diagrams. It can be shown that every route,
if marked out with a red pencil, will form one or other of the designs
indicated by the edges of the cards, or a reflection thereof. Let us
direct our attention to Fig. 1. Here the card is so placed that the
star is at the town T; it therefore gives us (by following the edge of
the card) one of the circular routes from London: L, S, R, T, M, A, E,
P, O, J, D, C, B, G, N, Q, K, H, F, I, L. If we went the other way, we
should get L, I, F, H, K, Q, etc., but these reverse routes were not
to be counted. When we have written out this first route we revolve
the card until the <span class='pagenum'>Pg 202<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>star is at M, when we get another different route,
at A a third route, at E a fourth route, and at P a fifth route. We
have thus obtained five different routes by revolving the card as it
lies. But it is evident that if we now take up the card and replace it
with the other side uppermost, we shall in the same manner get five
other routes by revolution.</p>

<p>We therefore see how, by using the revolving card in Fig. 1, we may,
without any difficulty, at once write out ten routes. And if we employ
the cards in Figs. 2 and 3, we similarly obtain in each case ten other
routes. These thirty routes are all that are possible. I do not give
the actual proof that the three cards exhaust all the possible cases,
but leave the reader to reason that out for himself. If he works out
any route at haphazard, he will certainly find that it falls into one
or other of the three categories.</p>

<p>Let us confine our attention to the L in the top left-hand corner.
Suppose we go by way of the E on the right: we must then go straight
on to the V, from which letter the word may be completed in four ways,
for there are four E's available through which we may reach an L.
There are therefore four ways of reading through the right-hand E. It
is also clear that there must be the same number of ways through the E
that is immediately below our starting point. That makes eight. If,
however, we take the third route through the E on the diagonal, we
then have the option of any one of the three V's, by means of each of
which we may complete the word in four ways. We can therefore spell
LEVEL in twelve ways through the diagonal E. Twelve added to eight
gives twenty readings, all emanating from the L in the top left-hand
corner; and as the four corners are equal, the answer must be four
times twenty, or eighty different ways.</p>

<p>There are 252 different ways. The general formula is that, for words
of <i>n</i> letters (not palindromes, as in the case of the next puzzle),
when grouped in this manner, there are always 2<sup>(n+1)</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;4 different
readings. This does not allow diagonal readings, such as you would get
if you used instead such a word as DIGGING, where it would be possible
to pass from one G to another G by a diagonal step.</p>

<p>The correct answer is 1,992 different ways. Every F is either a corner
F or a side F&mdash;standing next to a corner in its own square of F's.
Now, FIED may be read <i>from</i> a corner F in 16 ways; therefore DEIF may
be read <i>into</i> a corner F also in 16 ways; hence DEIFIED may be read
<i>through</i> a corner F in 16&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;16&nbsp;=&nbsp;256 ways. Consequently, the four
corner F's give 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;256&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,024 ways. Then FIED may be read from a
side F in 11 ways, and DEIFIED therefore in 121 ways. But there are
eight side F's; consequently these give together 8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;121&nbsp;=&nbsp;968 ways.
Add 968 to 1,024 and we get the answer, 1,992.</p>

<p>In this form the solution will depend on whether the number of letters
in the palindrome be odd or even. For example, if you apply the word
NUN in precisely the same manner, you will get 64 different readings;
but if you use the word NOON, you will only get 56, because you cannot
use the same letter twice in immediate succession (since you must
"always pass from one letter to another") or diagonal readings, and
every reading must involve the use of the central N.</p>

<p>The reader may like to find for himself the general formula in this
case, which is complex and difficult. I will merely add that for such
a case as MADAM, dealt with in the same way as DEIFIED, the number of
readings is 400.</p>

<p>THE number of readings here is 63,504, as in the case of "WAS IT A RAT

<p>Starting from any one of the N's, there are 17 different readings of
NAH, or 68 (4 times 17) for the 4 N's. Therefore there are also 68
ways of spelling HAN. If we were allowed to use the same N twice in a
spelling, the answer would be 68 times 68, or 4,624 ways. But the
conditions were, "always passing from one letter to another."
Therefore, for every one of the 17 ways of spelling HAN with a
particular N, there would be 51 ways (3 times 17) of completing the
NAH, or 867 (17 times 51) ways for the complete word. Hence, as there
are four N's to use in HAN, the correct solution of the puzzle is
3,468 (4 times 867) different ways.</p>

<p>The problem of the Bridges may be reduced to the simple diagram shown
in illustration. The <span class='pagenum'>Pg 203<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>point M represents the Monk, the point I the
Island, and the point Y the Monastery. Now the only direct ways from M
to I are by the bridges <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>; the only direct ways from I to Y
are by the bridges <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>; and there is a direct way from M to Y
by the bridge <i>e</i>. Now, what we have to do is to count all the routes
that will lead from M to Y, passing over all the bridges, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>,
<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>e</i> once and once only. With the simple diagram under
the eye it is quite easy, without any elaborate rule, to count these
routes methodically. Thus, starting from <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, we find there are
only two ways of completing the route; with <i>a, c</i>, there are only two
routes; with <i>a</i>, <i>d</i>, only two routes; and so on. It will be found
that there are sixteen such routes in all, as in the following list:&mdash;</p>

<p>If there were no conditions whatever, except that the men were all to
go out together, in threes, they could row in an immense number of
different ways. If the reader wishes to know how many, the number is
455<sup>7</sup>. And with the condition that no two may ever be together more
than once, there are no fewer than 15,567,552,000 different
solutions&mdash;that is, different ways of arranging the men. With one
solution before him, the reader will realize why this must be, for
although, as an example, A must go out once with B and once with C, it
does not necessarily follow that he must go out with C on the same
occasion that he goes with B. He might take any other letter with him
on that occasion, though the fact of his taking other than B would
have its effect on the arrangement of the other triplets.</p>

<p>Of course only a certain number of all these arrangements are
available when we have that other condition of using the smallest
possible number of boats. As a matter of fact we need employ only ten

<p>It will be found that no two men ever go out twice together, and that
no man ever goes out twice in the same boat.</p>

<p>This is an extension of the well-known problem of the "Fifteen
Schoolgirls," by Kirkman. The original conditions were simply that
fifteen girls walked out on seven days in triplets without any girl
ever walking twice in a triplet with another girl. Attempts at a
general solution of this puzzle had exercised the ingenuity of
mathematicians since 1850, when the question was first propounded,
until recently. In 1908 and the two following years I indicated (see
<i>Educational Times Reprints</i>, Vols. XIV., XV., and XVII.) that all our
trouble had arisen from a failure to discover that 15 is a special
case (too small to enter into the general law for all higher numbers
of girls of the form 6<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;3), and showed what that general law is and
how the groups should be posed for any number of girls. I gave actual
arrangements for numbers that had previously baffled all attempts to
manipulate, and the problem may now be considered generally solved.
Readers will find an excellent full account of the puzzle in W.W.
Rouse Ball's <i>Mathematical Recreations</i>, 5th edition.</p>

<p>The fifteen letters used are A, E, I, O, U, Y, and B, C, G, L, M, N,
P, R, T. The number of words is 27, and these are all shown in the
first three columns. The last word, PIU, is a musical term in common
use; but although it has crept into some of our dictionaries, it is
Italian, meaning "a little; slightly." The remaining twenty-six are
good words. Of course a TAU-cross is a T-shaped cross, also called the
cross of St. Anthony, and borne on a badge in the Bishop's Palace at
Exeter. It is also a name for the toad-fish.</p>

<p>We thus have twenty-six good words and one doubtful, obtained under
the required conditions, and I do not think it will be easy to improve
on this answer. Of course we are not bound by dictionaries but by
common usage. If we went by the dictionary only in a case of this
kind, we should find ourselves involved in prefixes, contractions, and
such absurdities as I.O.U., which Nuttall actually gives as a word.</p>

<p>Every boy will then have walked by the side of every other boy once
and once only.</p>

<p>Dealing with the problem generally, 12<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;9 boys may walk out in
triplets under the conditions on 9<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;6 days, where n may be nought or
any integer. Every possible pair will occur once. Call the number of
boys <i>m</i>. Then every boy will pair <i>m</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 times, of which <sup>(<i>m</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1)</sup>/<sub>4</sub> times he
will be in the middle of a triplet and <sup>(<i>m</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1)</sup>/<sub>2</sub> times on the outside.
Thus, if we refer to the solution above, we find that every boy is in
the middle twice (making 4 pairs) and four times on the outside
(making the remaining 4 pairs of his 8). The reader may now like to
try his hand at solving the two next cases of 21 boys on 15 days, and
33 boys on 24 days. It is, perhaps, interesting to note that a school
of 489 boys could thus walk out daily in one leap year, but it would
take 731 girls (referred to in the solution to No. 269) to perform
their particular feat by a daily walk in a year of 365 days.</p>

<p>The history of this problem will be found in <i>The Canterbury Puzzles</i>
(No. 90). Since the publication of that book in 1907, so far as I
know, nobody has succeeded in solving the case for that unlucky number
of persons, 13, seated at a table on 66 occasions. A solution is
possible for any number of persons, and I have recorded schedules for
every number up to 25 persons inclusive and for 33. But as I know a
good many mathematicians are still considering the case of 13, I will
not at this stage rob them of the pleasure of solving it by showing
the answer. But I will now display the solutions for all the cases up
to 12 persons inclusive. Some of these solutions are now published for
the first time, and they may afford useful clues to investigators.</p>

<p>The solution for the case of 3 persons seated on 1 occasion needs no
remark.</p>

<p>Each line represents the order for a sitting, and the person
represented by the last number in a line must, of course, be regarded

<p>It will now no longer be necessary to give the solutions in full, for
reasons that I will explain. It will be seen in the examples above
that the 1 (and, in the case of 5 persons, also the 2) <span class='pagenum'>Pg 206<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>is repeated
down the column. Such a number I call a "repeater." The other numbers
descend in cyclical order. Thus, for 6 persons we get the cycle, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 2, and so on, in every column. So it is only necessary to
give the two lines 1 2 3 6 4 5 and 1 2 4 5 6 3, and denote the cycle
and repeaters, to enable any one to write out the full solution
straight away. The reader may wonder why I do not start the last
solution with the numbers in their natural order, 1 2 3 4 5 6. If I
did so the numbers in the descending cycle would not be in their
natural order, and it is more convenient to have a regular cycle than
to consider the order in the first line.</p>

<p>There are several ways of solving the puzzle, but there is very little
difference between them. The solver should, however, first of all bear
in mind that in making his calculations he need only consider the four
villas that stand at the corners, because the intermediate villas can
never vary when the corners are known. One way is to place the numbers
nought to 9 one at a time in the top left-hand corner, and then
consider each case in turn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/a276.png" width="500" height="343" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now, if we place 9 in the corner as shown in the Diagram A, two of the
corners cannot be occupied, while the corner that is diagonally
opposite may be filled by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 persons. We
thus see that there are 10<span class='pagenum'>Pg 207<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
solutions with a 9 in the corner. If, however, we substitute 8, the
two corners in the same row and column may contain 0, 0, or 1, 1, or
0, 1, or 1, 0. In the case of B, ten different selections may be made
for the fourth corner; but in each of the cases C, D, and E, only nine
selections are possible, because we cannot use the 9. Therefore with 8
in the top left-hand corner there are 10&nbsp;+&nbsp;(3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;9)&nbsp;=&nbsp;37 different
solutions. If we then try 7 in the corner, the result will be 10&nbsp;+&nbsp;27
+ 40, or 77 solutions. With 6 we get 10&nbsp;+&nbsp;27&nbsp;+&nbsp;40&nbsp;+&nbsp;49&nbsp;=&nbsp;126; with 5,
10&nbsp;+&nbsp;27&nbsp;+&nbsp;40&nbsp;+&nbsp;49&nbsp;+&nbsp;54&nbsp;=&nbsp;180; with 4, the same as with 5,&nbsp;+&nbsp;55&nbsp;=&nbsp;235
; with 3, the same as with 4,&nbsp;+&nbsp;52&nbsp;=&nbsp;287; with 2, the same as with 3,
+ 45&nbsp;=&nbsp;332; with 1, the same as with 2,&nbsp;+&nbsp;34&nbsp;=&nbsp;366, and with nought in
the top left-hand corner the number of solutions will be found to be
10&nbsp;+&nbsp;27&nbsp;+&nbsp;40&nbsp;+&nbsp;49&nbsp;+&nbsp;54&nbsp;+&nbsp;55&nbsp;+&nbsp;52&nbsp;+&nbsp;45&nbsp;+&nbsp;34&nbsp;+&nbsp;19&nbsp;=&nbsp;385. As there is no
other number to be placed in the top left-hand corner, we have now
only to add these totals together thus, 10&nbsp;+&nbsp;37&nbsp;+&nbsp;77&nbsp;+&nbsp;126&nbsp;+&nbsp;180&nbsp;+&nbsp;235
+ 287&nbsp;+&nbsp;332&nbsp;+&nbsp;366&nbsp;+&nbsp;385&nbsp;=&nbsp;2,035. We therefore find that the total
number of ways in which tenants may occupy some or all of the eight
villas so that there shall be always nine persons living along each
side of the square is 2,035. Of course, this method must obviously
cover all the reversals and reflections, since each corner in turn is
occupied by every number in all possible combinations with the other
two corners that are in line with it.</p>

<p>Here is a general formula for solving the puzzle: <sup>(<i>n</i>&sup2;&nbsp;+&nbsp;3<i>n</i> +
2)(<i>n</i>&sup2;&nbsp;+&nbsp;3<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;3)</sup>/<sub>6</sub>. Whatever may be the stipulated number of
residents along each of the sides (which number is represented by
<i>n</i>), the total number of different arrangements may be thus
ascertained. In our particular case the number of residents was nine.
Therefore (81&nbsp;+&nbsp;27&nbsp;+&nbsp;2)&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;(81&nbsp;+&nbsp;27&nbsp;+&nbsp;3) and the product, divided by 6,
gives 2,035. If the number of residents had been 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, or 8, the total arrangements would be 1, 7, 26, 70, 155, 301, 532,
876, or 1,365 respectively.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 208<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span>Of course, the number in the middle is common to both arms. The first
pair is the one I gave as an example. I will suppose that we have
written out all these crosses, always placing the first row of a pair
in the upright and the second row in the horizontal arm. Now, if we
leave the central figure fixed, there are 24 ways in which the numbers
in the upright may be varied, for the four counters may be changed in
1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;24 ways. And as the four in the horizontal may also be
changed in 24 ways for every arrangement on the other arm, we find
that there are 24&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;24&nbsp;=&nbsp;576 variations for every form; therefore, as
there are 18 forms, we get 18&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;576&nbsp;=&nbsp;10,368 ways. But this will
include half the four reversals and half the four reflections that we
barred, so we must divide this by 4 to obtain the correct answer to
the Greek Cross, which is thus 2,592 different ways. The division is
by 4 and not by 8, because we provided against half the reversals and
reflections by always reserving one number for the upright and the
other for the horizontal.</p>

<p>In the case of the Latin Cross, it is obvious that we have to deal
with the same 18 forms of pairing. The total number of different ways
in this case is the full number, 18&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;576. Owing to the fact that the
upper and lower arms are unequal in length, permutations will repeat
by reflection, but not by reversal, for we cannot reverse. Therefore
this fact only entails division by 2. But in every pair we may
exchange the figures in the upright with those in the horizontal
(which we could not do in the case of the Greek Cross, as the arms are
there all alike); consequently we must multiply by 2. This
multiplication by 2 and division by 2 cancel one another. Hence 10,368
is here the correct answer.</p>

<p>This is quite easy to solve for any number of barrels&mdash;if you know
how. This is the way to do it. There are five barrels in each row
Multiply the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 together; and also multiply 6, 7,
8, 9, 10 together. Divide one result by the other, and we get the
number of different combinations or selections of ten things taken
five at a time. This is here 252. Now, if we divide this by 6 (1 more
than the number in the row) we get 42, which is the correct answer to
the puzzle, for there are 42 different ways of arranging the barrels.
Try this method of solution in the case of six barrels, three in each
row, and you will find the answer is 5 ways. If you check this by
trial, you will discover the five arrangements with 123, 124, 125,
134, 135 respectively in the top row, and you will find no others.</p>

<p>Take your constructed pyramid and hold it so that one stick only lies
on the table. Now, four sticks must branch off from it in different
directions&mdash;two at each end. Any one of the five sticks may be left
out of this connection; therefore the four may be selected in 5
different ways. But these four matches may be placed in 24 different
orders. And as any match may be joined at either of its ends, they may
further be varied (after their situations are settled for any
particular arrangement) in 16 different ways. In every arrangement the
sixth stick may be added in 2 different ways. Now multiply these
results together, and we get 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;24&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;16&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;3,840 as the exact
number of ways in which the pyramid may be constructed. This method
excludes all possibility of error.</p>

<p>A common cause of error is this. If you calculate your combinations by
working upwards from a basic triangle lying on the table, you will get
half the correct number of ways, because you overlook the fact that an
equal number of pyramids may be built on that triangle downwards, so
to speak, through the table. They are, in fact, reflections of the
others, and examples from the two sets of pyramids cannot be set up to
resemble one another&mdash;except under fourth dimensional conditions!</p>

<p>It will be convenient to imagine that we are painting our pyramids on
the flat cardboard, as in the diagrams, before folding up. Now, if we
take any <i>four</i> colours (say red, blue, green, and yellow), they may
be applied in only 2 distinctive ways, as shown in Figs, 1 and 2. Any
other way will only result in one of these when the pyramids are
folded up. If we take any <i>three</i> colours, they may be applied in the
3 ways shown in Figs. 3, 4, and 5. If we take any <i>two</i> colours, they
may be applied in the 3 <span class='pagenum'>Pg 209<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span>ways shown in Figs. 6, 7, and 8. If we take
any <i>single</i> colour, it may obviously be applied in only 1 way. But
four colours may be selected in 35 ways out of seven; three in 35
ways; two in 21 ways; and one colour in 7 ways. Therefore 35 applied
in 2 ways&nbsp;=&nbsp;70; 35 in 3 ways&nbsp;=&nbsp;105; 21 in 3 ways&nbsp;=&nbsp;63; and 7 in 1 way
= 7. Consequently the pyramid may be painted in 245 different ways (70

accordance with the conditions of the puzzle.</p>

<p>The number of ways in which nine things may be arranged in a row
without any restrictions is 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;9 =
362,880. But we are told that the two circular rings must never be
together; therefore we must deduct the number of times that this would
occur. The number is 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;8&nbsp;=&nbsp;40,320&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2 =
80,640, because if we consider the two circular links to be
inseparably joined together they become as one link, and eight links
are capable of 40,320 arrangements; but as these two links may always
be put on in the orders AB or BA, we have to double this number, it
being a question of arrangement and not of design. The deduction
required reduces our total to 282,240. Then one of our links is of a
peculiar form, like an 8. We have therefore the option of joining on
either one end or the other on every occasion, so we must double the
last result. This brings up our total to 564,480.</p>

<p>We now come to the point to which I directed the reader's
attention&mdash;that every link may be put on in one of two ways. If we
join the first finger and thumb of our left hand horizontally, and
then link the first finger and thumb of the right hand, we see that
the right thumb may be either above or below. But in the case of our
chain we must remember that although that 8-shaped link has two
independent <i>ends</i> it is like every other link in having only two
<i>sides</i>&mdash;that is, you cannot turn over one end without turning the
other at the same time.</p>

<p>We will, for convenience, assume that each link has a black side and a
side painted white. Now, if it were stipulated that (with the chain
lying on the table, and every successive link falling over its
predecessor in the same way, as in the diagram) only the white sides
should be uppermost as in A, then the answer would be 564,480, as
above&mdash;ignoring for the present all reversals of the completed chain.
If, however, the first link were allowed to be placed either side up,
then we could have either A or B, and the answer would be 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;564,480
= 1,128,960; if two links might be placed either way up, the answer
would be 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;564,480; if three links, then 8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;564,480, and so on.
Since, therefore, every link may be placed either side up, the number
will be 564,480 multiplied by 2<sup>9</sup>, or by 512. This raises our total to
289,013,760.</p>

<p>But there is still one more point to be considered. We have not yet
allowed for the fact that with any given arrangement three of the
other arrangements may be obtained by simply turning the chain over
through its entire length and by reversing the ends. Thus C is really
the same as A, and if we turn this page upside down, then A and C give
two other arrangements that are still really identical. Thus to get
the correct answer to the puzzle we must divide our last total by 4,
when we find that there are just 72,253,440 different ways in which
the smith might have put those links together. In other words, if the
nine links had originally formed a piece of chain, and it was known
that the two circular links were separated, then it would be
72,253,439 chances to 1 that the smith would not have put the links
together again precisely as they were arranged before!</p>

<p>The reader may have noticed that at each end of the line I give is a
four, so that, if we like, we can form a ring instead of a line. It
can easily be proved that this must always be so. Every line
arrangement will make a circular arrangement if we like to join the
ends. Now, curious as it may at first appear, the following diagram
exactly represents the conditions when we leave the doubles out of the
question and devote our attention to forming circular arrangements.
Each number, or half domino, is in line with every other number, so
that if we start at any one of the five numbers and go over all the
lines of the pentagon once and once only we shall come back to the
starting place, and the order of our route will give us one of the
circular arrangements for the ten <span class='pagenum'>Pg 210<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span>dominoes. Take your pencil and
follow out the following route, starting at the 4: 41304210234. You
have been over all the lines once only, and by repeating all these
figures in this way, 41&mdash;13&mdash;30&mdash;04&mdash;42&mdash;21&mdash;10&mdash;02&mdash;23&mdash;34, you get
an arrangement of the dominoes (without the doubles) which will be
perfectly clear. Take other routes and you will get other
arrangements. If, therefore, we can ascertain just how many of these
circular routes are obtainable from the pentagon, then the rest is
very easy.</p>

<p>Well, the number of different circular routes over the pentagon is
264. How I arrive at these figures I will not at present explain,
because it would take a lot of space. The dominoes may, therefore, be
arranged in a circle in just 264 different ways, leaving out the
doubles. Now, in any one of these circles the five doubles may be
inserted in 2<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;32 different ways. Therefore when we include the
doubles there are 264&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;32&nbsp;=&nbsp;8,448 different circular arrangements.
But each of those circles may be broken (so as to form our straight
line) in any one of 15 different places. Consequently, 8,448&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;15
gives 126,720 different ways as the correct answer to the puzzle.</p>

exactly the same size <span class='pagenum'>Pg 211<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span>and shape. Every way must involve one of the
five cuts shown in Diagrams A, B, C, D, and E. To avoid repetitions by
reversal and reflection, we need only consider cuts that enter at the
points a, b, and c. But the exit must always be at a point in a
straight line from the entry through the centre. This is the most
important condition to remember. In case B you cannot enter at a, or
you will get the cut provided for in E. Similarly in C or D, you must
not enter the key-line in the same direction as itself, or you will
get A or B. If you are working on A or C and entering at a, you must
consider joins at one end only of the key-line, or you will get
repetitions. In other cases you must consider joins at both ends of
the key; but after leaving a in case D, turn always either to right or
left&mdash;use one direction only. Figs. 1 and 2 are examples under A; 3
and 4 are examples under B; 5 and 6 come under C; <span class='pagenum'>Pg 212<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span>and 7 is a pretty example of D. Of course, E is a peculiar type, and
obviously admits of only one way of cutting, for you clearly cannot
enter at b or c.</p>

<p>There are fifteen different ways of cutting the 5x5 board (with the
central square removed) into two pieces of the same size and shape.
Limitations of space will not allow me to give diagrams of all these,
but I will enable the reader to draw them all out for himself without
the slightest difficulty. At whatever point on the edge your cut
enters, it must always end at a point on the edge, exactly opposite in
a line through the centre of the square. Thus, if you enter at point 1
(see Fig. 1) at the top, you must leave at point 1 at the bottom. Now,
1 and 2 are the only two really different points of entry; if we use
any others they will simply produce similar solutions. The directions
of the cuts in the following fifteen</p>

<p>solutions are indicated by the numbers on the diagram. The duplication
of the numbers can lead to no confusion, since every successive number
is contiguous to the previous one. But whichever direction you take
from the top downwards you must repeat from the bottom upwards, one
direction being an exact reflection of the other.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the fourth direction (1, 4, 3, 7, 10, 6, 5, 9)
produces the solution shown in Fig. 2. The thirteenth produces the
solution given in propounding the puzzle, where the cut entered at the

not constitute a different solution.</p>

<p>The man who was "learned in strange mysteries" pointed out to Father
John that the orders of the Lord Abbot of St. Edmondsbury might be
easily carried out by blocking up twelve of the lights in the window
as shown by the dark squares in the following sketch:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/a292.png" width="400" height="388" alt="" title="" />

<p>Father John held that the four corners should also be darkened, but
the sage explained that it was desired to obstruct no more light than
was absolutely necessary, and he said, anticipating Lord Dundreary, "A
single pane can no more be in a <i>line</i> with itself than one bird can
go into a corner and flock in solitude. The Abbot's condition was that
no diagonal <i>lines</i> should contain an odd number of lights."</p>

<p>Now, when the holy man saw what had been done he was well pleased, and
said, "Truly, Father John, thou art a man of deep wisdom, in that thou
hast done that which seemed impossible, and yet withal adorned our
window with a device of the cross of St. Andrew, whose name I received
from my godfathers and godmothers." Thereafter he slept well and arose
refreshed. The window might be seen intact to-day in the monastery of
St. Edmondsbury, if it existed, which, alas! the window does not.</p>

<p>Obviously there must be a rook in every row and every column. Starting
with the top row, it is clear that we may put our first rook on any
one of eight different squares. Wherever it is placed, we have the
option of seven squares for the second rook in the second row. Then we
have six squares from which to select the third row, five in the
fourth, and so on. Therefore the number of our different ways must be
8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1&nbsp;=&nbsp;40,320 (that is 8!), which is the
correct answer.</p>

<p>How many ways there are if mere reversals and reflections are not
counted as different has not yet been determined; it is a difficult
problem. But this point, on a smaller square, is considered in the
next puzzle.</p>

3. Taking the last example, this notation means that we place a lion
in the second square of first row, fourth square of second row, first
square of third row, and third square of fourth row. The first example
is, of course, the one we gave when setting the puzzle.</p>

<p>This cannot be done with fewer bishops than eight, and the simplest
solution is to place the bishops in line along the fourth or fifth row
of the board (see diagram). But it will be noticed that no bishop is

<p>This puzzle is quite easy if you first of all give it a little
thought. You need only consider squares of one colour, for whatever
can be done in the case of the white squares can always be repeated on
the black, and they are here quite independent of one another. This
equality, of course, is in consequence of the fact that the number of
squares on an ordinary chessboard, sixty-four, is an even number. If a
square chequered board has an odd number of squares, then there will
always be one more square of one colour than of the other.</p>

<p>Ten bishops are necessary in order that every square shall be attacked
and every bishop guarded by another bishop. I give one way of
arranging them in the diagram. It will be noticed that the two central
bishops in the group <span class='pagenum'>Pg 215<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>of six on the left-hand side of the board serve
no purpose, except to protect those bishops that are on adjoining
squares. Another solution would therefore be obtained by simply
raising the upper one of these one square and placing the other a
square lower down.</p>

<p>The fourteen bishops may be placed in 256 different ways. But every
bishop must always be placed on one of the sides of the board&mdash;that
is, somewhere on a row or file on the extreme edge. The puzzle,
therefore, consists in counting the number of different ways that we can
arrange the fourteen round the edge of the board without attack. This is
not a difficult matter. On a chessboard of <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> squares
<i>2n&nbsp;-&nbsp;2</i> bishops (the maximum number) may always be placed in 2<sup>(<i>n</i>)</sup> ways
without attacking. On an ordinary chessboard <i>n</i> would be 8; therefore
14 bishops may be placed in 256 different ways. It is rather curious
that the general result should come out in so simple a form.</p>

<p>The solution of this puzzle is shown in the first diagram. It is the
only possible solution within the conditions stated. But if one of the
eight stars had not already been placed as shown, there would then
have been eight ways of arranging the stars according to this scheme,
if we count reversals and reflections as different. If you turn this
page round so that each side is in turn at the bottom, you will get
the four reversals; and if you reflect each of these in a mirror, you
will get the four reflections. These are, therefore, merely eight
aspects of one "fundamental solution." But without that first star
being so placed, there is another fundamental solution, as shown in
the second diagram. But this arrangement being in a way symmetrical,
only produces four different aspects by reversal and reflection.</p>

<p>Some schemes give more diagonal readings of four letters than others,
and we are at first tempted to favour these; but this is a false
scent, because what you appear to gain in this direction you lose in
others. Of course it immediately occurs to the solver that every LIVE
or EVIL is worth twice as much as any other word, since it reads both
ways and always counts as 2. This is an important consideration,
though sometimes those arrangements that contain most readings of
these two words are fruitless in other words, and we lose in the
general count.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p>The above diagram is in accordance with the conditions requiring no
letter to be in line with another similar letter, and it gives twenty
readings of the five words&mdash;six horizontally, six vertically, four in
the diagonals indicated by the arrows on the left, and four in the
diagonals indicated by the arrows on the right. This is the maximum.</p>

<p>Four sets of eight letters may be placed on the board of sixty-four
squares in as many as 604 different ways, without any letter ever
being in line with a similar one. This does not count reversals and
reflections as different, and it does not take into consideration the
actual permutations of the letters among themselves; that is, for
example, making the L's change places with the E's. Now it is a
singular fact that not only do the twenty word-readings that I have
given prove to be the real maximum, but there is actually only that
one arrangement from which this maximum may be obtained. But if you
make the V's change places with the I's, and the L's with the E's, in
the solution given, you still get twenty readings&mdash;the same number as
before in every direction. Therefore there are two ways of getting the
maximum from the same arrangement. The minimum number of readings is
zero&mdash;that is, the letters can be so arranged that no word can be read
in any of the directions.</p>

<p>Let us use the letters A, K, Q, J, to denote ace, king, queen, jack;
and D, S, H, C, to denote diamonds, spades, hearts, clubs. In Diagrams
1 and 2 we have the two available ways of arranging either group of
letters so that no two similar letters shall be in line&mdash;though a
quarter-turn of 1 will give us the arrangement in 2. If we superimpose
or combine these two squares, we get the arrangement of Diagram 3,
which is one solution. But in each square we may put the letters in
the top line in twenty-four different ways without altering the scheme
of arrangement. Thus, in Diagram 4 the S's are similarly placed to the
D's in 2, the H's to the S's, the C's to the H's, and the D's to the
C's. It clearly follows that there must be 24&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;24&nbsp;=&nbsp;576 ways of
combining the two primitive arrangements. But the error that Labosne
fell into was that of assuming that the A, K, Q, J must be arranged in
the form 1, and the D, S, H, C in the form 2. He thus included
reflections and half-turns, but not quarter-turns. They may obviously
be interchanged. So that the correct answer is 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;576&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,152, counting
reflections and reversals as different. Put in another manner, the
pairs in the top row may be written in 16&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;9 &times;4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;576 different ways,
and the square then completed in 2 ways, making 1,152 ways in all.</p>

possible.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 217<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span>This requires a little judgment and careful investigation, or we are
liable to jump to the hasty conclusion that the proper way to solve
the puzzle must be first to place all six of one letter, then all six
of another letter, and so on. As there is only one scheme (with its
reversals) for placing six similar letters so that no two shall be in
a line in any direction, the reader will find that after he has placed
four different kinds of letters, six times each, every place is
occupied except those twelve that form the two long diagonals. He is,
therefore, unable to place more than two each of his last two letters,
and there are eight blanks left. I give such an arrangement in Diagram
1.</p>

<p>The secret, however, consists in not trying thus to place all six of
each letter. It will be found that if we content ourselves with
placing only five of each letter, this number (thirty in all) may be
got into the box, and there will be only six blanks. But the correct
solution is to place six of each of two letters and five of each of
the remaining four. An examination of Diagram 2 will show that there

<p>Here is the solution. Only 8 queens or 8 rooks can be placed on the
board without attack, while the greatest number of bishops is 14, and
of knights 32. But as all these knights must be placed on squares of
the same colour, while the queens occupy four of each colour and the
bishops 7 of each colour, it follows that only 21 knights can be
placed on the same colour in this puzzle. More than 21 knights can be
placed alone on the board if we use both colours, but I have not
succeeded in placing more than 21 on the "crowded chessboard." I
believe the above solution contains the maximum number of pieces, but
possibly some ingenious reader may succeed in getting in another
knight.</p>

<p>This, of course, means that if you place sheep in the pens marked A
and B, then there are seven different pens in which you may place the
third sheep, giving seven different solutions. It was understood that
reversals and reflections do not count as different.</p>

<p>If one pen at least is to be <i>not</i> in line with a sheep, there would
be thirty solutions to that problem. If we counted all the reversals
and reflections of these 47 and 30 cases respectively as different,
their total would be 560, which is the number of different ways in
which the sheep may be placed in three pens without any conditions. I
will remark that there are three ways in which two sheep may be placed
so that every pen is occupied or in line, as in Diagrams 2, 3, and 4,
but in every case each sheep is in line with its companion. There are
only two ways in which three sheep may be so placed that every pen
shall be occupied or in line, but no sheep in line with another. These
I show in Diagrams 5 and 6. Finally, there is only one way in which
three sheep may be placed so that at least one pen shall not be in
line with a sheep and yet no sheep in line with another. Place the
sheep in C, E, L. This is practically all there is to be said on this
pleasant pastoral subject.</p>

the next column to the right and both of the two central horizontal
rows. Thus A gives 8 solutions. Then B may be reversed and placed in
either diagonal, giving 4 solutions. Similarly C will give 4
solutions. The line in D being symmetrical, its reversal will not be
different, but it may be disposed in 4 different directions. We thus
have in all 20 different solutions.</p>

to exactly half of the pavement. It is a very curious fact that,
although there are two or three solutions allowing a carpet to be laid
down within the conditions so as to cover an area of nearly
twenty-nine of the tiles, this is the only possible solution giving
exactly half the area of the pavement, which is the largest space

Planck. But I have since found the accompanying solution with three
queens, a rook, and a bishop, though the pieces do not protect one
another. (Fig. 5.)</p>

<p>My readers have been so familiarized with the fact that it requires at
least five planets to attack every one of a square arrangement of
sixty-four stars that many of them have, perhaps, got to believe that
a larger square arrangement of stars must need an increase of planets.
It was to correct this possible error of reasoning, and so warn
readers against another of those numerous little pitfalls in the world
of puzzledom, that I devised this new stellar problem. Let me then
state at once that, in the case of a square arrangement of eighty one
stars, there are several ways of placing five planets so that every
star shall be in line with at least one planet vertically,
horizontally, or diagonally. Here is the solution to the "Southern
Cross": &mdash;</p>

at present covered." This was to exclude an easier solution in which
only four planets need be moved.</p>

<p>The moves will be made quite clear by a reference to the diagrams,
which show the position on the board after each of the four moves. The
darts indicate the successive removals that have been made. It will be
seen that at every stage all the squares are either attacked or
occupied, and that after the fourth move no queen attacks any other.
In the case of the last move the queen in the top row might also have
been moved one square farther to the left. This is, I believe, the
only solution to the puzzle.</p>

<p>It will be seen that only three queens have been removed from their
positions on the edge of the board, and that, as a consequence, eleven
squares (indicated by the black dots) are left unattacked by any
queen. I will hazard the statement that eight queens cannot be placed
on the chessboard so as to leave more than eleven squares unattacked.
It is true that we have no rigid proof of this yet, but I have

<p>There are 6,480 ways of placing the man and the lion, if there are no
restrictions whatever except that they must be on different spots.
This is obvious, because the man may be placed on any one of the 81
spots, and in every case there are 80 spots remaining for the lion;
therefore 81&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;80&nbsp;=&nbsp;6,480. Now, if we deduct the number of ways in
which the lion and the man may be placed on the same path, the result
must be the number of ways in which they will not be on the same path.
The number of ways in which they may be in line is found without much
difficulty to be 816. Consequently, 6,480&nbsp;-&nbsp;816&nbsp;=&nbsp;5,664, the required
answer.</p>

<p>The general solution is this: <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>n(n&nbsp;-&nbsp;1) (3n<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;n&nbsp;+&nbsp;2). This is, of
course, equivalent to saying that if we call the number of squares on
the side of a "chessboard" <i>n</i>, then the formula shows the number of
ways in which two bishops may be placed without attacking one another.
Only in this case we must divide by two, because the two bishops have
no distinct individuality, and cannot produce a different solution by
mere exchange of places.</p>

<p>Seven knights can be placed on the board on white squares so as to
attack every black square in two ways only. These are shown in
Diagrams 1 and 2. Note that three knights occupy the same position in
both arrangements. It is therefore clear that if we turn the board so
that a black square shall be in the top left-hand corner instead of a
white, and place the knights in exactly the same positions, we shall
have two similar ways of attacking all the white squares. I will
assume the reader has made the two last described diagrams on
transparent paper, and marked them <i>1a</i> and <i>2a</i>. Now, by placing the
transparent Diagram <i>1a</i> over 1 you will be able to obtain the
solution in Diagram 3, by placing <i>2a</i> over 2 you will get Diagram 4,
and by placing <i>2a</i> over 1 you will get Diagram 5. You may now try all
possible combinations of those two pairs of diagrams, but you will
only get the three arrangements I have given, or their reversals and
reflections. Therefore these three solutions are all that exist.</p>

<p>First of all, the fewest possible straight lines in each case are
twenty-two, and in order that no cell may be visited twice it is
absolutely necessary that each should pass into one cell and then
immediately "visit" the one from which he started, afterwards
proceeding by way of the second available cell. In the following
diagram the man's route is indicated by the unbroken lines, and the
lion's by the dotted lines. It will be found, if the two routes are
followed cell by cell with two pencil points, that the lion and the
man never meet. But there was one little point that ought not to be
overlooked&mdash;"they occasionally got glimpses of one another." Now, if
we take one route for the <span class='pagenum'>Pg 225<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span>man and merely reverse it for the lion, we
invariably find that, going at the same speed, they never get a
glimpse of one another. But in our diagram it will be found that the
man and the lion are in the cells marked A at the same moment, and may
see one another through the open doorways; while the same happens when
they are in the two cells marked B, the upper letters indicating the
man and the lower the lion. In the first case the lion goes straight
for the man, while the man appears to attempt to get in the rear of
the lion; in the second case it looks suspiciously like running away
from one another!</p>

<p>The correct solution to this puzzle is shown in the diagram by the
dark line. The five moves indicated will take the queen the greatest
distance that it is possible for her to go in five moves, within the
conditions. The dotted line shows the route that most people suggest,
but it is not quite so long as the other. Let us assume that the
distance from the centre of any square to the centre of the next in
the same horizontal or vertical line is 2 inches, and that the queen
travels from the centre of her original square to the centre of the
one at which she rests. Then the first route will be found to exceed
67.9 inches, while the dotted route is less than 67.8 inches. The
difference is small, but it is sufficient to settle the point as to
the longer route. All other routes are shorter still than these two.</p>

<p>There are several interesting points involved in this question. In the
first place, if we had made no stipulation as to the positions of the
two ends of the string, it is quite impossible to form any such string
unless we begin and end in the top and bottom row of kennels. We may
begin in the top row and end in the bottom (or, of course, the
reverse), or we may begin in one of these rows and end in the same.
But we can never begin or end in one of the two central rows. Our
places of starting and ending, however, were fixed for us. Yet the
first half of our route must be confined entirely to those squares
that are distinguished in the following diagram by circles, and the
second half will therefore be confined to the squares that are not
circled. The squares reserved for the two half-strings will be seen to
be symmetrical and similar.</p>

<p>The next point is that the first half-string must end in one of the
central rows, and the <span class='pagenum'>Pg 228<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>second half-string must begin in one of these
rows. This is now obvious, because they have to link together to form
the complete string, and every square on an outside row is connected
by a knight's move with similar squares only&mdash;that is, circled or
non-circled as the case may be. The half-strings can, therefore, only
be linked in the two central rows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/a336.png" width="400" height="337" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now, there are just eight different first half-strings, and
consequently also eight second half-strings. We shall see that these
combine to form twelve complete strings, which is the total number
that exist and the correct solution of our puzzle. I do not propose to
give all the routes at length, but I will so far indicate them that if
the reader has dropped any he will be able to discover which they are
and work them out for himself without any difficulty. The following
numbers apply to those in the above diagram.</p>

<p>The eight first half-strings are: 1 to 6 (2 routes); 1 to 8 (1 route);
1 to 10 (3 routes); 1 to 12 (1 route); and 1 to 14 (1 route). The
eight second half-strings are: 7 to 20 (1 route); 9 to 20 (1 route);
11 to 20 (3 routes); 13 to 20 (1 route); and 15 to 20 (2 routes).
Every different way in which you can link one half-string to another
gives a different solution. These linkings will be found to be as
follows: 6 to 13 (2 cases); 10 to 13 (3 cases); 8 to 11 (3 cases); 8
to 15 (2 cases); 12 to 9 (1 case); and 14 to 7 (1 case). There are,
therefore, twelve different linkings and twelve different answers to
the puzzle. The route given in the illustration with the greyhound
will be found to consist of one of the three half-strings 1 to 10,
linked to the half-string 13 to 20. It should be noted that ten of the
solutions are produced by five distinctive routes and their
reversals&mdash;that is, if you indicate these five routes by lines and
then turn the diagrams upside down you will get the five other routes.
The remaining two solutions are symmetrical (these are the cases where
12 to 9 and 14 to 7 are the links), and consequently they do not
produce new solutions by reversal.</p>

<p>A pretty symmetrical solution to this puzzle is shown in the diagram.
Each of the four kangaroos makes his little excursion and returns to
his corner, without ever entering a square that has been visited by
another kangaroo and without crossing the central line. It will at
once occur to the reader, as a possible improvement of the puzzle, to
divide the board by a central vertical line and make the condition
that this also shall not be crossed. This would mean that each
kangaroo had to confine himself to a square 4 by 4, but it would be
quite impossible, as I shall explain in the next two puzzles.</p>

<p>In attempting to solve this problem it is first necessary to take the
two distinctive compartments of twenty and twelve squares respectively
and analyse them with a view to deter<span class='pagenum'>Pg 229<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span>mining where the necessary
points of entry and exit lie. In the case of the larger compartment it
will be found that to complete a tour of it we must begin and end on
two of the outside squares on the long sides. But though you may start
at any one of these ten squares, you are restricted as to those at
which you can end, or (which is the same thing) you may end at
whichever of these you like, provided you begin your tour at certain
particular squares. In the case of the smaller compartment you are
compelled to begin and end at one of the six squares lying at the two
narrow ends of the compartments, but similar restrictions apply as in
the other instance. A very little thought will show that in the case
of the two small compartments you must begin and finish at the ends
that lie together, and it then follows that the tours in the larger
compartments must also start and end on the contiguous sides.</p>

<p>In the diagram given of one of the possible solutions it will be seen
that there are eight places at which we may start this particular
tour; but there is only one route in each case, because we must
complete the compartment in which we find ourself before passing into
another. In any solution we shall find that the squares distinguished
by stars must be entering or exit points, but the law of reversals
leaves us the option of making the other connections either at the
diamonds or at the circles. In the solution worked out the diamonds
are used, but other variations occur in which the circle squares are
employed instead. I think these remarks explain all the essential
points in the puzzle, which is distinctly instructive and interesting.</p>

a cube, and stick it together by the strips left for that purpose at
the edges, he would have an interesting little curiosity. Or he can
make one on a larger scale for himself. It will be found that if we
imagine the cube to have a complete chessboard on each of its sides,
we may start with the knight on any one of the 384 squares, and make a
complete tour of the cube, always returning to the starting-point. The
method of passing from one side of the cube to another is easily
understood, but, of course, the difficulty consisted in finding the
proper points of entry and exit on each board, the order in which the
different boards should be taken, and in getting arrangements that
would comply with the required conditions.</p>

<p>The fewest possible moves, counting every move separately, are
sixteen. But the puzzle may be solved in seven plays, as follows, if
any number of successive moves by one frog count as a single play. All
the moves contained within a bracket are a single play; the numbers
refer to the toadstools: (1&mdash;5), (3&mdash;7, 7&mdash;1), (8&mdash;4, 4&mdash;3, 3&mdash;7),
(6&mdash;2, 2&mdash;8, 8&mdash;4, 4&mdash;3), (5&mdash;6, 6&mdash;2, 2&mdash;8), (1&mdash;5, 5&mdash;6), (7&mdash;1).</p>

<p>This is the familiar old puzzle by Guarini, propounded in 1512, and I
give it here in order to explain my "buttons and string" method of
solving this class of moving-counter problem.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 230<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span>Diagram A shows the old way of presenting Guarini's puzzle, the point
being to make the white knights change places with the black ones. In
"The Four Frogs" presentation of the idea the possible directions of
the moves are indicated by lines, to obviate the necessity of the
reader's understanding the nature of the knight's move in chess. But
it will at once be seen that the two problems are identical. The
central square can, of course, be ignored, since no knight can ever
enter it. Now, regard the toadstools as buttons and the connecting
lines as strings, as in Diagram B. Then by disentangling these strings
we can clearly present the diagram in the form shown in Diagram C,
where the relationship between the buttons is precisely the same as in
B. Any solution on C will be applicable to B, and to A. Place your
white knights on 1 and 3 and your black knights on 6 and 8 in the C
diagram, and the simplicity of the solution will be very evident. You
have simply to move the knights round the circle in one direction or
the other. Play over the moves given above, and you will find that
every little difficulty has disappeared.</p>

<p>In Diagram D I give another familiar puzzle that first appeared in a
book published in Brussels in 1789, <i>Les Petites Aventures de Jerome
Sharp</i>. Place seven counters on seven of the eight points in the
following manner. You must always touch a point that is vacant with a
counter, and then move it along a straight line leading from that
point to the next vacant point (in either direction), where you
deposit the counter. You proceed in the same way until all the
counters are placed. Remember you always touch a vacant place and
slide the counter from it to the next place, which must be also
vacant. Now, by the "buttons and string" method of simplification we
can transform the diagram into E. Then the solution becomes obvious.
"Always move <i>to</i> the point that you last moved <i>from</i>." This is not,
of course, the only way of placing the counters, but it is the
simplest solution to carry in the mind.</p>

<p>There are several puzzles in this book that the reader will find lend
themselves readily to this method.</p>

<p>The rather perplexing point that the solver has to decide for himself
in attacking this puzzle is whether the shaded numbers (those that are
shown in their right places) are mere dummies or not. Ninety-nine
persons out of a hundred might form the opinion that there can be no
advantage in moving any of them, but if so they would be wrong.</p>

<p>The shortest solution without moving any shaded number is in
thirty-two moves. But the puzzle can be solved in thirty moves. The
trick lies in moving the 6, or the 15, on the second move and
replacing it on the nineteenth move. Here is the solution:
2, 6, 13, 4, 1, 21, 4, 1, 10, 2, 21, 10, 2, 5, 22, 16, 1, 13, 6, 19, 11, 2, 5, 22, 16, 5, 13, 4, 10, 21.
Thirty moves.</p>

<p>There are eighty different arrangements of the numbers in the form of
a perfect knight's path, but only forty of these can be reached
without two men ever being in a cell at the same time. Two is the
greatest number of men that can be given a complete rest, and though
the <span class='pagenum'>Pg 231<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></span>knight's path can be arranged so as to leave either 7 and 13, 8
and 13, 5 and 7, or 5 and 13 in their original positions, the
following four arrangements, in which 7 and 13 are unmoved, are the
only ones that can be reached under the moving conditions. It
therefore resolves itself into finding the fewest possible moves that
will lead up to one of these positions. This is certainly no easy
matter, and no rigid rules can be laid down for arriving at the
correct answer. It is largely a matter for individual judgment,
patient experiment, and a sharp eye for revolutions and position.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the position C can be reached in as few as
sixty-six moves in the following manner: 12, 11, 15, 12, 11, 8, 4, 3,
2, 6, 5, 1, 6, 5, 10, 15, 8, 4, 3, 2, 5, 10, 15, 8, 4, 3, 2, 5, 10,

2, 5, 10, 15, 4, 9, 12, 2, 5, 3, 11, 14, 2, 5, 14, 11&nbsp;=&nbsp;66 moves.
Though this is the shortest that I know of, and I do not think it can
be beaten, I cannot state positively that there is not a shorter way
yet to be discovered. The most tempting arrangement is certainly A;
but things are not what they seem, and C is really the easiest to
reach.</p>

<p>If the bottom left-hand corner cell might be left vacant, the
following is a solution in forty-five moves by Mr. R. Elrick: 15, 11,
10, 9, 13, 14, 11, 10, 7, 8, 4, 3, 8, 6, 9, 7, 12, 4, 6, 9, 5, 13, 7,

<p>The first point is to make a choice of the most promising knight's
string and then consider the question of reaching the arrangement in
the fewest moves. I am strongly of opinion that the best string is the
one represented in the following diagram, in which it will be seen
that each successive number is a knight's move from the preceding one,
and that five of the dogs (1, 5, 10, 15, and 20) never leave their
original kennels.</p>

<p>This position may be arrived at in as few as forty-six moves, as
follows: 16&mdash;21, 16&mdash;22, 16&mdash;23, 17&mdash;16, 12&mdash;17, 12&mdash;22, 12&mdash;21,7&mdash;12,

I am, of course, not able to say positively that a solution cannot be
discovered in fewer moves, but I believe it will be found a very hard
task to reduce the number.</p>

<p>Call one pawn A and the other B. Now, owing to that optional first
move, either pawn may make either 5 or 6 moves in reaching the eighth
square. There are, therefore, four cases to be considered: (1) A 6
moves and B 6 moves; (2) A 6 moves and B 5 moves; (3) A 5 moves and B
6 moves; (4) A 5 moves and B 5 moves. In case (1) there are 12 moves,
and we may select any 6 of these for A. Therefore 7&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;12
divided by 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6 gives us the number of variations for this
case&mdash;that is, 924. Similarly for case (2), 6 selections out of 11
will be 462; in case (3), 5 selections out of 11 will also be 462; and
in case (4), 5 selections out of 10 will be 252. Add these four
numbers together and we get 2,100, which is the correct number of
different ways in which the pawns may advance under the conditions.

<p>The White pawns may be arranged in 40,320 ways, the White rooks in 2
ways, the bishops in 2 ways, and the knights in 2 ways. Multiply these
numbers together, and we find that the White pieces may be placed in
322,560 different <span class='pagenum'>Pg 232<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></span>ways. The Black pieces may, of course, be placed in
the same number of ways. Therefore the men may be set up in 322,560 &times;
322,560&nbsp;=&nbsp;104,044,953,600 ways. But the point that nearly everybody
overlooks is that the board may be placed in two different ways for
every arrangement. Therefore the answer is doubled, and is

<p>There are 1,296 different rectangles in all, 204 of which are squares,
counting the square board itself as one, and 1,092 rectangles that are
not squares. The general formula is that a board of <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> squares
contains <span class='su2'>((<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>n</i>)<sup>2</sup>)</span>/<sub>4</sub> rectangles, of which <span class='su2'>(2<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;3<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>n</i>)</span>/<sub>6</sub>

<p>The answer involves the little point that in the final position the
numbered rooks must be in numerical order in the direction contrary to
that in which they appear in the original diagram, otherwise it cannot
be solved. Play the rooks in the following order of their numbers. As
there is never more than one square to which a rook can move (except
on the final move), the notation is obvious&mdash;5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 4, 3, 6,
4, 7, 5, 4, 7, 3, 6, 7, 3, 5, 4, 3, 1, 8, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 8, 2, 1,
and rook takes bishop, checkmate. These are the fewest possible
moves&mdash;thirty-two. The Black king's moves are all forced, and need not

originally stands at the beginning of a game. Though, if Black plays
badly, he may, in certain positions, be mated in fewer moves, the

<p>Mr Black left his king on his queen's knight's 7th, and no matter what
piece White chooses for his pawn, Black cannot be checkmated. As we
said, the Black king takes no notice of checks and never moves. White
may queen his pawn, capture the Black rook, and bring his three pieces
up to the attack, but mate is quite impossible. The Black king cannot
be left on any other square without a checkmate being possible.</p>

puzzle is based.</p>

Black's KB 2nd. Now, White plays P to K 5th, check, and Black must
play P to B 4th. Then White plays P takes P <i>en passant</i>, checkmate.
This was therefore White's last move, and leaves the position given.

<p>If you place the pieces as follows (where only a portion of the board
is given, to save space), the Black king is in check, with no possible
move open to him. The reader will now see why I avoided the term
"checkmate," apart from the fact that there is no White king. The
position is impossible in the game of chess, because Black could not be
given check by both rooks at the same time, nor could he have moved into
check on his last move.</p>

<p>The general formula for six pawns on all squares greater than 2<sup>2</sup> is
this: Six times the square of the number of combinations of <i>n</i> things
taken three at a time, where <i>n</i> represents the number of squares on
the side of the board. Of course, where <i>n</i> is even the unoccupied
squares in the rows and columns will be even, and where <i>n</i> is odd the
number of squares will be odd. Here <i>n</i> is 8, so the answer is 18,816
different ways. This is "The Dyer's Puzzle" (<i>Canterbury Puzzles</i>, No.
27) in another form. I repeat it here in order to explain a method of
solving that will be readily grasped by the novice. First of all, it
is evident that if we put a pawn on any line, we must put a second one
in that line in order that the remainder may be even in number. We
cannot put four or six in any row without making it impossible to get
an even number in all the columns interfered with. We have, therefore,
to put two pawns in each of three rows and in each of three columns.
Now, there are just six schemes or arrangements that fulfil these
conditions, and these are shown in Diagrams A to F, inclusive, on next
page.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 234<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/a358.png" width="400" height="218" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>I will just remark in passing that A and B are the only distinctive
arrangements, because, if you give A a quarter-turn, you get F; and if
you give B three quarter-turns in the direction that a clock hand
moves, you will get successively C, D, and E. No matter how you may
place your six pawns, if you have complied with the conditions of the
puzzle they will fall under one of these arrangements. Of course it
will be understood that mere expansions do not destroy the essential
character of the arrangements. Thus G is only an expansion of form A.
The solution therefore consists in finding the number of these
expansions. Supposing we confine our operations to the first three
rows, as in G, then with the pairs <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> placed in the first and
second columns the pair <i>c</i> may be disposed in any one of the
remaining six columns, and so give six solutions. Now slide pair <i>b</i>
into the third column, and there are five possible positions for <i>c</i>.
Slide <i>b</i> into the fourth column, and <i>c</i> may produce four new
solutions. And so on, until (still leaving <i>a</i> in the first column)
you have <i>b</i> in the seventh column, and there is only one place for
<i>c</i>&mdash;in the eighth column. Then you may put <i>a</i> in the second column,
<i>b</i> in the third, and <i>c</i> in the fourth, and start sliding <i>c</i> and <i>b</i>
as before for another series of solutions.</p>

<p>We find thus that, by using form A alone and confining our operations
to the three top rows, we get as many answers as there are
combinations of 8 things taken 3 at a time. This is <sup>(8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6)</sup>/<sub>(1 &times;
2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3)</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;56. And it will at once strike the reader that if there are
56 different ways of electing the columns, there must be for each of
these ways just 56 ways of selecting the rows, for we may
simultaneously work that "sliding" process downwards to the very
bottom in exactly the same way as we have worked from left to right.
Therefore the total number of ways in which form A may be applied is
56&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6&nbsp;=&nbsp;3,136. But there are, as we have seen, six arrangements, and
we have only dealt with one of these, A. We must, therefore, multiply
this result by 6, which gives us 3,136&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6&nbsp;=&nbsp;18,816, which is the
total number of ways, as we have already stated.</p>

double in the second transaction. And the water must not be more than
three times the quantity of milk, or there will not be enough liquid
in B to effect the second transaction. The third transaction has no
effect on A, as the relative proportions in it must be the same as
after the second transaction. It was introduced to prevent a quibble

inch. Now make eleven depths of such seventy-two slabs, and we have

<p>The only way in which the barrels could be equally divided among the
three brothers, so that each should receive his 3½ barrels of honey
and his 7 barrels, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is one other way in which the division could be made, were it
not for the objection that all the brothers made to taking more than
four barrels of the same description. Except for this difficulty, they
might have given B his quantity in exactly the same way as A above,
and then have left C one full barrel, five half-full barrels, and one
empty barrel. It will thus be seen that in any case two brothers would
have to receive their allowance in the same way.</p>

if the five husbands had not been jealous of one another the party
might have all got over in nine crossings. But no wife was to be in

<p>There is a little subtlety concealed in the words "show the <i>quickest</i>
way."</p>

<p>Everybody correctly assumes that, as we are told nothing of the rowing
capabilities of the party, we must take it that they all row equally
well. But it is obvious that two such persons should row more quickly
than one.</p>

<p>Therefore in the second and third crossings two of the ladies should
take back the boat to fetch d, not one of them only. This does not
affect the number of landings, so no time is lost on that account. A
similar opportunity occurs in crossings 10 and 11, where the party
again had the option of sending over two ladies or one only.</p>

<p>To those who think they have solved the puzzle in nine crossings I
would say that in every case they will find that they are wrong. No
such jealous husband would, in the circumstances, send his wife over
to the other bank to a man or men, even if she assured him that she
was coming back next time in the boat. If readers will have this fact
in mind, they will at once discover their errors.</p>

necessary in order to cross under the conditions laid down. It can be

twenty-four are needed), and it cannot be done in fewer. I will give

<p>Having found the fewest possible passages, we should consider two
other points in deciding on the "quickest method": Which persons were
the most expert in handling the oars, and which method entails the
fewest possible delays in getting in and out of the boat? We have no
data upon which to decide the first point, though it is probable that,
as the boat belonged to the girls' household, they would be capable
oarswomen. The other point, however, is important, and in the solution
I have given (where the girls do 8-13ths of the rowing and A and D
need not row at all) there are only sixteen gettings-in and sixteen
gettings-out. A man and a girl are never in the boat together, and no
man ever lands on the island. There are other methods that require
several more exchanges of places.</p>

<p>There are twenty-three different ways. You may start with any domino,
except the 4&mdash;4 and those that bear a 5 or 6, though only certain
initial dominoes may be played either way round. If you are given the
common difference and the first domino is played, you have no option
as to the other dominoes. Therefore all I need do is to give the
initial domino for all the twenty-three ways, and state the common
difference. This I will do as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>With a common difference of 1, the first domino may be either of
these: 0&mdash;0, 0&mdash;1, 1&mdash;0, 0&mdash;2, 1&mdash;1, 2&mdash;0, 0&mdash;3, 1&mdash;2, 2&mdash;1, 3&mdash;0,

difference of 2, the first domino may be 0&mdash;0, 0&mdash;2, or 0&mdash;1. Take the
last case of all as an example. Having played the 0&mdash;1, and the
difference being 2, we are <span class='pagenum'>Pg 238<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span>compelled to continue with 1&mdash;2, 2&mdash;3,
3&mdash;4. 4&mdash;5, 5&mdash;6. There are three dominoes that can never be used at
all. These are 0&mdash;5, 0&mdash;6, and 1&mdash;6. If we used a box of dominoes
extending to 9&mdash;9, there would be forty different ways.</p>

<p>The illustration is a solution. It will be found that all four sides
of the frame add up 44. The sum of the pips on all the dominoes is
168, and if we wish to make the sides sum to 44, we must take care
that the four corners sum to 8, because these corners are counted
twice, and 168 added to 8 will equal 4 times 44, which is necessary.
There are many different solutions. Even in the example given certain
interchanges are possible to produce different arrangements. For
example, on the left-hand side the string of dominoes from 2&mdash;2 down
to 3&mdash;2 may be reversed, or from 2&mdash;6 to 3&mdash;2, or from 3&mdash;0 to 5&mdash;3.
Also, on the right-hand side we may reverse from 4&mdash;3 to 1&mdash;4. These
changes will not affect the correctness of the solution.</p>

<p>The sum of all the pips on the ten cards is 55. Suppose we are trying
to get 14 pips on every side. Then 4 times 14 is 56. But each of the
four corner cards is added in twice, so that 55 deducted from 56, or
1, must represent the sum of the four corner cards. This is clearly
impossible; therefore 14 is also impossible. But suppose we came to
trying 18. Then 4 times 18 is 72, and if we deduct 55 we get 17 as the
sum of the corners. We need then only try different arrangements with
the four corners always summing to 17, and we soon discover the
following solution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p>The final trials are very limited in number, and must with a little
judgment either bring us to a correct solution or satisfy us that a
solution is impossible under the conditions we are attempting. The two
centre cards on the upright sides can, of course, always be
interchanged, but I do not call these different solutions. If you
reflect in a mirror you get another arrangement, which also is not
considered different. In the answer given, however, we may exchange
the 5 with the 8 and the 4 with the 1. This is a different solution.
There are two solutions with 18, four with 19, two with 20, and two
with 22&mdash;ten arrangements in all. Readers may like to find all these
for themselves.</p>

<p>If we remove the ace, the remaining cards may he divided into two
groups (each adding up alike) in four ways; if we remove 3, there are
three ways; if 5, there are four ways; if 7, there are three ways; and
if we remove 9, there are four ways of making two equal groups. There
are thus eighteen different ways of grouping, and if we take any one
of these and keep the odd card (that I have called "removed") at the
head of the column, then one set of numbers can be varied in order in
twenty-four ways in the column and the other four twenty-four ways in
the horizontal, or together they may be varied in 24&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;24&nbsp;=&nbsp;576 ways.
And as there are eighteen such cases, we multiply this number by 18
and get 10,368, the correct number of ways of placing the cards. As
this number includes the reflections, we must divide by 2, but we have
also to remember that every horizontal row can change places with a
vertical row, necessitating our multiplying by 2; so one operation
cancels the other.</p>

summing to 19, six summing to 20, four summing to 21, and two summing

White might have placed his rook at A and won next move. Any square on

restrict the moves of the opposing rook as much as possible. If White
played first, then Black should have placed his rook at B (F would not
be so good, as it gives White more scope); then if White goes to C,
Black moves to D; White to E, Black to F; White to G, Black to C;
White to H, Black to I; and Black must win next move. If at any time
Black had failed to move on to the same diagonal as White, then White

<p>The Britisher can always catch the enemy, no matter how clever and
elusive that astute individual may be; but curious though it may seem,
the British general can only do so after he has paid a somewhat
mysterious visit to the particular town marked "1" in the map, going
in by 3 and leaving by 2, or entering by 2 and leaving by 3. The three
towns that are shaded and have no numbers do not really come into the
question, as some may suppose, for the simple reason that the
Britisher never needs to enter any one of them, while the enemy cannot
be forced to go into them, and would be clearly ill-advised to do so
voluntarily. We may therefore leave these out of consideration
altogether. No matter what the enemy may do, the Britisher should make
the follow<span class='pagenum'>Pg 241<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></span>ing first nine moves: He should visit towns 24, 20, 19,
15, 11, 7, 3, 1, 2. If the enemy takes it into his head also to go to
town 1, it will be found that he will have to beat a precipitate
retreat <i>the same way that he went in</i>, or the Britisher will
infallibly catch him in towns 2 or 3, as the case may be. So the enemy
will be wise to avoid that north-west corner of the map altogether.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/a395.png" width="400" height="396" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now, when the British general has made the nine moves that I have
given, the enemy will be, after his own ninth move, in one of the
towns marked 5, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 24, or 27. Of course, if he
imprudently goes to 3 or 6 at this point he will be caught at once.
Wherever he may happen to be, the Britisher "goes for him," and has no
longer any difficulty in catching him in eight more moves at most
(seventeen in all) in one of the following ways. The Britisher will
get to 8 when the enemy is at 5, and win next move; or he will get to
19 when the enemy is at 22, and win next move; or he will get to 24
when the enemy is at 27, and so win next move. It will be found that
he can be forced into one or other of these fatal positions.</p>

<p>In short, the strategy really amounts to this: the Britisher plays the
first nine moves that I have given, and although the enemy does his
very best to escape, our general goes after his antagonist and always
driving him away from that north-west corner ultimately closes in with
him, and wins. As I have said, the Britisher never need make more than
seventeen moves in all, and may win in fewer moves if the enemy plays
badly. But after playing those first nine moves it does not matter
even if the Britisher makes a few bad ones. He may lose time, but
cannot lose his advantage so long as he now keeps the enemy from town
1, and must eventually catch him.</p>

<p>This is a complete explanation of the puzzle. It may seem a little
complex in print, but in practice the winning play will now be quite
easy to the reader. Make those nine moves, and there ought to be no
difficulty whatever in finding the concluding line of play. Indeed, it
might almost be said that then it is difficult for the British general
<i>not</i> to catch the enemy. It is a question of what in chess we call
the "opposition," and the visit by the Britisher to town 1 "gives him
the jump" on the enemy, as the man in the street would say.</p>

<p>Here is an illustrative example in which the enemy avoids capture as
long as it is possible for him to do so. The Britisher's moves are
above the line and the enemy's below it. Play them alternately.</p>

<p>If you form the three heaps (and are therefore the second to draw),
any one of the following thirteen groupings will give you a win if you
play correctly: 15, 14, 1; 15, 13, 2; 15, 12, 3; 15, 11, 4; 15, 10, 5;
15, 9, 6; 15, 8, 7; 14, 13, 3; 14, 11, 5; 14, 9, 7; 13, 11, 6; 13, 10,

remembering that 2<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. Then if you so leave the matches to your
opponent that there is an even number of every power, you can win. And
if at the start you leave the powers even, you can always continue to
do so throughout the game. Take, as example, the last grouping given

<p>Not a single member of the club mastered this puzzle, and yet I shall
show that it is so simple that the merest child can understand its
solution&mdash;when it is pointed out to him! The large majority of my
friends expressed their entire bewilderment. Many considered that "the
theoretical result, in any case, is determined by the relationship
between the table and the cigars;" others, regarding it as a problem
in the theory of Probabilities, arrived at the conclusion that the
chances are slightly in favour of the first or second player, as the
case may be. One man took a table and a cigar of particular
dimensions, divided the table into equal sections, and proceeded to
make the two players fill up these sections so that the second player
should win. But why should the first player be so accommodating? At
any stage he has only to throw down a cigar obliquely across several
of these sections entirely to upset Mr. 2's calculations! We have to
assume that each player plays the best possible; not that one
accommodates the other.</p>

<p>The theories of some other friends would be quite sound if the shape
of the cigar were that of a torpedo&mdash;perfectly symmetrical and pointed
at both ends.</p>

<p>I will show that the first player should infallibly win, if he always
plays in the best possible manner. Examine carefully the following
diagram, No. 1, and all will be clear.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/a398.png" width="400" height="208" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The first player must place his first cigar <i>on end</i> in the exact
centre of the table, as indicated by the little circle. Now, whatever
the second player may do throughout, the first player must always
repeat it in an exactly diametrically opposite position. Thus, if the
second player places a cigar at A, I put one at AA; he places one at
B, I put one at BB; he places one at C, I put one at CC; he places one
at D, I put one at DD; he places one at E, I put one at EE; and so on
until no more cigars can be placed without touching. As the cigars are
supposed to be exactly alike in every respect, it is perfectly clear
that for every move that the second player may choose to make, it is
possible exactly to repeat it on a line drawn through the centre of
the table. The second player can always duplicate the first player's
move, no matter where he may place a cigar, or whether he places it on
end or on its side. As the cigars are all alike in every respect, one
will obviously balance over the edge of the table at precisely the
same point as another. Of course, as each player is supposed to play
in the best possible manner, it becomes a matter of theory. It is no
valid objection to say that in actual practice one would not be
sufficiently exact to be sure of winning. If as the first player you
did not win, it would be in consequence of your <i>not</i> having played
the best possible.</p>

<p>The second diagram will serve to show why the first cigar must be
placed on end. (And here I will say that the first cigar that I
selected from a box I was able so to stand on end, and I am allowed to
assume that all the other cigars would do the same.) If the first
cigar were placed on its side, as at F, then the second player could
place a cigar as at G&mdash;as near as possible, but not actually touching
F. Now, in this position you cannot repeat his play on the opposite
side, because the two ends of the cigar are not alike. It will be seen
that GG, when placed on the opposite side in the same relation to the
centre, intersects, or lies on top of, F, whereas the cigars are not
allowed to touch. You must therefore put the cigar farther away from
the centre, which would result in your having insufficient room
between the centre and the bottom left-hand corner to repeat
everything that the other player would do between G and the top
right-hand corner. Therefore the result would not be a certain win for
the first player.</p>

cells so that the three rows, <span class='pagenum'>Pg 243<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>three columns, and two diagonals should
each add up 15. Probably the reader at first set himself an impossible
task through reading into these conditions something which is not
there&mdash;a common error in puzzle-solving. If I had said "a different
figure," instead of "a different number," it would have been quite
impossible with the 8 placed anywhere but in a corner. And it would
have been equally impossible if I had said "a different whole number."
But a number may, of course, be fractional, and therein lies the
secret of the puzzle. The arrangement shown in the figure will be
found to comply exactly with the conditions: all the numbers are
different, and the square adds up 15 in all the required eight ways.</p>

that the uncut strip is at the top, but it will be found that if the
bottom row of figures be placed at the top the numbers will still form
a magic square, and that every successive removal from the bottom to
the top (carrying the uncut strip stage by stage to the bottom) will
produce the same result. If we imagine the numbers to be on seven
complete <i>perpendicular</i> strips, it will be found that these columns
could also be moved in succession from left to right or from right to
left, each time producing a magic square.</p>

<p>There are eight ways of forming the magic square&mdash;all merely different
aspects of one fundamental arrangement. Thus, if you give our first
square a quarter turn you will get the second square; and as the four
sides may be in turn brought to the top, there are four aspects. These
four in turn reflected in a mirror produce the remaining four aspects.
Now, of these eight arrangements only four can possibly be reached
under the conditions, and only two of these four can be reached in the
fewest possible moves, which is nineteen. These two arrangements are
shown. Move the men in the following order: 5, 3, 2, 5, 7, 6, 4, 1, 5,
7, 6, 4, 1, 6, 4, 8, 3, 2, 7, and you get the first square. Move them
thus: 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 6, 7, 1, 5, 8, 1, 5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 4, 2, 7, and you
have the arrangement in the second square. In the first case every man
has moved, but in the second case the man numbered 3 has never left
his cell. Therefore No. 3 must be the obstinate prisoner, and the
second square must be the required arrangement.</p>

<p>There is a pitfall set for the unwary in this little puzzle. At the
start one man is allowed to be placed on the shoulders of another, so
as to give always one empty cell to enable the prisoners to move about
without any two ever being in a cell together. The two united
prisoners are allowed to add their numbers together, and are, of
course, permitted to remain together at the completion of the magic
square. But they are obviously not compelled so to remain together,
provided that one of the pair on his final move does not break the
condition of entering a cell already occupied. After the acute solver
has noticed this point, it is for him to determine which method is the
better one&mdash;for the two to be together at the count or to separate. As
a matter of fact, the puzzle can be solved in seventeen moves if the
men are to remain together; but if they separate at the<span class='pagenum'>Pg 244<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span>
end, they may actually save a move and perform the feat in sixteen!
The trick consists in placing the man in the centre on the back of one
of the corner men, and then working the pair into the centre before
their final separation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p>Here are the moves for getting the men into one or other of the above
two positions. The numbers are those of the men in the order in which
they move into the cell that is for the time being vacant. The pair is
shown in brackets:&mdash;</p>

<p>Place 5 on 1. Then, 6, 9, 8, 6, 4, (6), 2, 4, 9, 3, 4, 9, (6), 7, 6,
1.</p>

<p>Place 5 on 9. Then, 4, 1, 2, 4, 6, (14), 8, 6, 1, 7, 6, 1, (14), 3, 4,
9.</p>

<p>Place 5 on 3. Then, 6, (8), 2, 6, 4, 7, 8, 4, 7, 1, 6, 7, (8), 9, 4,
3.</p>

<p>Place 5 on 7. Then, 4, (12), 8, 4, 6, 3, 2, 6, 3, 9, 4, 3, (12), 1, 6,
7.</p>

<p>The first and second solutions produce Diagram A; the second and third
produce Diagram B. There are only sixteen moves in every case. Having
found the fewest moves, we had to consider how we were to make the
burdened man do as little work as possible. It will at once be seen
that as the pair have to go into the centre before separating they
must take at fewest two moves. The labour of the burdened man can only
be reduced by adopting the other method of solution, which, however,
forces us to take another move.</p>

<p>This can best be solved by working backwards&mdash;that is to say, you must
first catch your square, and then work back to the original position.
We must first construct those squares which are found to require the
least amount of readjustment of the numbers. Many of these we know
cannot possibly be reached. When we have before us the most favourable
possible arrangements, it then becomes a question of careful analysis
to discover which position can be reached in the fewest moves. I am
afraid, however, it is only after considerable study and experience
that the solver is able to get such a grasp of the various "areas of
disturbance" and methods of circulation that his judgment is of much
value to him.</p>

<p>The second diagram is a most favourable magic square position. It will
be seen that prisoners 4, 8, 13, and 14 are left in their original
cells. This position may be reached in as few as thirty-seven moves.
Here are the moves: 15, 14, 10, 6, 7, 3, 2, 7, 6, 11, 3, 2, 7, 6, 11,
10, 14, 3, 2, 11, 10, 9, 5, 1, 6, 10, 9, 5, 1, 6, 10, 9, 5, 2, 12, 15,
3. This short solution will probably surprise many readers who may not
find a way under from sixty to a hundred moves. The clever prisoner
was No. 6, who in the original illustration will be seen with his arms
extended calling out the moves. He and No. 10 did most of the work,
each changing his cell five times. No. 12, the man with the crooked
leg, was lame, and therefore fortunately had only to pass from his
cell into the next one when his time came round.</p>

<p>In attempting to solve this puzzle it is clearly necessary to seek
such magic squares as seem the most favourable for our purpose, and
then carefully examine and try them for "fewest moves." Of course it
at once occurs to us that if we can adopt a square in which a certain
number of men need not leave their original cells, we may save moves
on the one hand, but we may obstruct our movements on the other. For
example, a magic square may be formed with the 6, 7, 13, and 16
unmoved; but in such case it is obvious that a solution is impossible,
since cells 14 and 15 can neither be left nor entered without breaking
the condition of no two men ever being in the same cell together.</p>

<p>The following solution in fourteen moves was found by Mr. G.
Wotherspoon: 8-17, 16-21, 6-16, 14-8, 5-18, 4-14, 3-24, 11-20, 10-19,
2-23, 13-22, 12-6, 1-5, 9-13. As this solution is in what I consider
the theoretical minimum number of moves, I am confident that it cannot
be improved upon, and on this point Mr. Wotherspoon is of the same
opinion.</p>

<p>The following is the square that I constructed. As it stands the
constant is 260. If for every number you substitute, in its allotted
place, its square, then the constant will be 11,180. Readers can write
out for themselves the second degree square.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/a408.png" width="400" height="398" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The main key to the solution is the pretty law that if eight numbers
sum to 260 and their squares to 11,180, then the same will happen in
the case of the eight numbers that are complementary to 65. Thus 1 +
18&nbsp;+&nbsp;23&nbsp;+&nbsp;26&nbsp;+&nbsp;31&nbsp;+&nbsp;48&nbsp;+&nbsp;56&nbsp;+&nbsp;57&nbsp;=&nbsp;260, and the sum of their squares
is 11,180. Therefore 64&nbsp;+&nbsp;47&nbsp;+&nbsp;42&nbsp;+&nbsp;39&nbsp;+&nbsp;34&nbsp;+&nbsp;17&nbsp;+&nbsp;9&nbsp;+&nbsp;8 (obtained by
subtracting each of the above numbers from 65) will sum to 260 and
their squares to 11,180. Note that in every one of the sixteen smaller
squares the two diagonals sum to 65. There are four columns and four
rows with their complementary columns and rows. Let us pick out the
numbers found in the 2nd, 1st, 4th, and 3rd rows and arrange them thus
:&mdash;</p>

<p>Here each column contains four consecutive numbers cyclically
arranged, four running in one direction and four in the other. The
numbers in the 2nd, 5th, 3rd, and 8th columns of the square may be
similarly grouped. The great difficulty lies in discovering the
conditions governing these groups of numbers, the pairing of the
complementaries in the squares of four and the formation of the
diagonals. But when a correct solution is shown, as above, it
discloses all the more important keys to the mystery. I am inclined to
think this square of two degrees the most elegant thing that exists in
magics. I believe such a magic square cannot be constructed in the
case of any order lower than 8.</p>

<p>As the merchant told his man to distribute the contents of one of the
baskets of plums "among some children," it would not be permissible to
give the complete basketful to one child; and as it was also directed
that the man was to give "plums to every child, so that each should
receive an equal number," it would also not be allowed to select just
as many children as there were plums in a basket and give each child a
single plum. Consequently, if the number of <span class='pagenum'>Pg 246<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></span>plums in every basket was
a prime number, then the man would be correct in saying that the
proposed distribution was quite impossible. Our puzzle, therefore,
resolves itself into forming a magic square with nine different prime
numbers.</p>

<p>In Diagram A we have a magic square in prime numbers, and it is the
one giving the smallest constant sum that is possible. As to the
little trap I mentioned, it is clear that Diagram A is barred out by
the words "every basket contained plums," for one plum is not plums.
And as we were referred to the baskets, "as shown in the
illustration," it is perfectly evident, without actually attempting to
count the plums, that there are at any rate more than 7 plums in every
basket. Therefore C is also, strictly speaking, barred. Numbers over
20 and under, say, 250 would certainly come well within the range of
possibility, and a large number of arrangements would come within
these limits. Diagram B is one of them. Of course we can allow for the
false bottoms that are so frequently used in the baskets of
fruitsellers to make the basket appear to contain more fruit than it
really does.</p>

<p>Several correspondents assumed (on what grounds I cannot think) that
in the case of this problem the numbers cannot be in consecutive
arithmetical progression, so I give Diagram D to show that they were
mistaken. The numbers are 199, 409, 619, 829, 1,039, 1,249, 1,459,
1,669, and 1,879&mdash;all primes with a common difference of 210.</p>

<p>The problem really amounts to finding the smallest prime such that the
next higher prime shall exceed it by 10 at least. If we write out a
little list of primes, we shall not need to exceed 150 to discover
what we require, for after 113 the next prime is 127. We can then form
the square in the diagram, where every number is composite. This is
the solution in the smallest numbers. We thus see that the answer is
arrived at quite easily, in a square of the third order, by trial. But
I propose to show how we may get an answer (not, it is true, the one
in smallest numbers) without any tables or trials, but in a very
direct and rapid manner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/a411.png" width="400" height="404" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>First write down any consecutive numbers, the smallest being greater
than 1&mdash;say, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The only factors in these
numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7. We therefore mul<span class='pagenum'>Pg 247<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></span>tiply these four numbers
together and add the product, 210, to each of the nine numbers. The
result is the nine consecutive composite numbers, 212 to 220
inclusive, with which we can form the required square. Every number
will necessarily be divisible by its difference from 210. It will be
very obvious that by this method we may find as many consecutive
composites as ever we please. Suppose, for example, we wish to form a
magic square of sixteen such numbers; then the numbers 2 to 17 contain
the factors 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17, which, multiplied together,
make 510510 to be added to produce the sixteen numbers 510512 to
510527 inclusive, all of which are composite as before.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, these are not the answers in the smallest
numbers: for if we add 523 to the numbers 1 to 16, we get sixteen
consecutive composites; and if we add 1,327 to the numbers 1 to 25, we
get twenty-five consecutive composites, in each case the smallest
numbers possible. Yet if we required to form a magic square of a
hundred such numbers, we should find it a big task by means of tables,
though by the process I have shown it is quite a simple matter. Even
to find thirty-six such numbers you will search the tables up to
10,000 without success, and the difficulty increases in an
accelerating ratio with each square of a larger order.</p>

Unfortunately, it is not a perfect magic square, because the diagonals
are incorrect, one adding up 264 and the other 256&mdash;requiring only the
transfer of 4 from one diagonal to the other. I think this is the best
result that has ever been obtained (either re-entrant or not), and
nobody can yet say whether a perfect solution is possible or
impossible.</p>

<p>The explanation of this little fallacy is as follows. The error lies
in assuming that the little triangular piece, marked C, is exactly the
same height as one of the little squares of the board. As a matter of
fact, its height (if we make the sixty-four squares each a square
inch) will be 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub> in. Consequently the rectangle is really 9<sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub> in.
by 7 in., so that the area is sixty-four square inches in either case.
Now, although the pieces do fit together exactly to form the perfect
rectangle, yet the directions of the horizontal lines in the pieces
will not coincide. The new diagram above will make everything quite
clear to the reader.</p>

<p>I will give my complete working of the solution, so that readers may
see how easy it is when you know how to proceed. And first of all, as
there is an even number of rings, I will say that they may all be
taken off in one-third of (2<sup>(n&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;2) moves; and since <i>n</i> in our
case is 14, all the rings may be taken off in 10,922 moves. Then I say
10,922&nbsp;-&nbsp;9,999&nbsp;=&nbsp;923, and proceed to find the position when only 923
out of the 10,922 moves remain to be made. Here is the curious method
of doing this. It is based on <span class='pagenum'>Pg 248<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a></span>the binary scale method used by
Monsieur L. Gros, for an account of which see W.W. Rouse Ball's
<i>Mathematical Recreations</i>.</p>

<p>Divide 923 by 2, and we get 461 and the remainder 1; divide 461 by 2,
and we get 230 and the remainder 1; divide 230 by 2, and we get 115
and the remainder nought. Keep on dividing by 2 in this way as long as
possible, and all the remainders will be found to be 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1,
1, 0, 1, 1, the last remainder being to the left and the first
remainder to the right. As there are fourteen rings and only ten
figures, we place the difference, in the form of four noughts, in
brackets to the left, and bracket all those figures that repeat a
figure on their left. Then we get the following arrangement: (0 0 0 0) 1
(1 1) 0 (0) 1 (1) 0 1 (1). This is the correct answer to the puzzle, for
if we now place rings below the line to represent the figures in
brackets and rings on the line for the other figures, we get the
solution in the required form, as below:&mdash;</p>

<p>This is the exact position of the rings after the 9,999th move has
been made, and the reader will find that the method shown will solve
any similar question, no matter how many rings are on the
tiring-irons. But in working the inverse process, where you are
required to ascertain the number of moves necessary in order to reach
a given position of the rings, the rule will require a little
modification, because it does not necessarily follow that the position
is one that is actually reached in course of taking off all the rings
on the irons, as the reader will presently see. I will here state that
where the total number of rings is odd the number of moves required to
take them all off is one-third of (2<sup>(<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1).</p>

<p>With <i>n</i> rings (where <i>n</i> is <i>odd</i>) there are 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> positions counting
all on and all off. In <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> (2<sup>(n+1)</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2) positions they are all
removed. The number of positions not used is (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>)(2<sup><i>n</i></sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;2).</p>

all on and all off. In (2<sup>(<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) positions they are all removed.
The number of positions not used is here (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>)(2<sup><i>n</i></sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1).</p>

<p>Note first that the number of <i>positions used</i> is one more than the
number of <i>moves</i> required to take all the rings off, because we are
including "all on" which is a position but not a move. Then note that
the number of <i>positions not used</i> is the same as the number of <i>moves
used</i> to take off a set that has one ring fewer. For example, it takes
85 moves to remove 7 rings, and the 42 positions not used are exactly
the number of moves required to take off a set of 6 rings. The fact is
that if there are 7 rings and you take off the first 6, and then wish
to remove the 7th ring, there is no course open to you but to reverse
all those 42 moves that never ought to have been made. In other words,
you must replace all the 7 rings on the loop and start afresh! You
ought first to have taken off 5 rings, to do which you should have
taken off 3 rings, and previously to that 1 ring. To take off 6 you
first remove 2 and then 4 rings.</p>

<p>The hasty reader will assume that the bookworm, in boring from the
first to the last page <span class='pagenum'>Pg 249<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></span>of a book in three volumes, standing in their
proper order on the shelves, has to go through all three volumes and
four covers. This, in our case, would mean a distance of 9½ in.,
which is a long way from the correct answer. You will find, on
examining any three consecutive volumes on your shelves, that the
first page of Vol. I. and the last page of Vol. III. are actually the
pages that are nearest to Vol. II., so that the worm would only have
to penetrate four covers (together, ½ in.) and the leaves in the
second volume (3 in.), or a distance of 3½ inches, in order to
tunnel from the first page to the last.</p>

<p>To open and rejoin a link costs threepence. Therefore to join the nine
pieces into an endless chain would cost 2<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>., whereas a new chain
would cost 2<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. But if we break up the piece of eight links, these
eight will join together the remaining eight pieces at a cost of 2<i>s</i>.
But there is a subtle way of even improving on this. Break up the two

will join together the remaining seven pieces at a cost of only 1<i>s</i>.

<p>The way the author of the old poser proposed to solve the difficulty
was as follows: From the Jew's abode let the Christian and the Turk
set out on a tour round the globe, the Christian going due east and
the Turk due west. Readers of Edgar Allan Poe's story, <i>Three Sundays
in a Week</i>, or of Jules Verne's <i>Round the World in Eighty Days</i>, will
know that such a proceeding will result in the Christian's gaining a
day and in the Turk's losing a day, so that when they meet again at
the house of the Jew their reckoning will agree with his, and all
three may keep their Sabbath on the same day. The correctness of this
answer, of course, depends on the popular notion as to the definition
of a day&mdash;the average duration between successive sun-rises. It is an
old quibble, and quite sound enough for puzzle purposes. Strictly
speaking, the two travellers ought to change their reckonings on
passing the 180th meridian; otherwise we have to admit that at the
North or South Pole there would only be one Sabbath in seven years.</p>

<p>In this case we were shown a sketch of the brooch exactly as it
appeared after the four rubies had been stolen from it. The reader was
asked to show the positions from which the stones "may have been
taken;" for it is not possible to show precisely how the gems were
originally placed, because there are many such ways. But an important
point was the statement by Lady Littlewood's brother: "I know the
brooch well. It originally contained forty-five stones, and there are
now only forty-one. Somebody has stolen four rubies, and then reset as
small a number as possible in such a way that there shall always be
eight stones in any of the directions you have mentioned."</p>

</div>

<p>The diagram shows the arrangement before the robbery. It will be seen
that it was only necessary to reset one ruby&mdash;the one in the centre.
Any solution involving the resetting of more than one stone is not in
accordance with the brother's statement, and must therefore be wrong.
The original arrangement was, of course, a little unsymmetrical, and
for this reason the brooch was described as "rather eccentric."</p>

<p>This puzzle is not nearly so easy as it looks at first sight. It was
required to find the smallest possible number of plates that would be
necessary to form a set for three hymn-boards, each of which would
show the five hymns sung at any particular service, and then to
discover the lowest possible cost for the same. The hymn-book contains
700 hymns, and therefore no higher number than 700 could possibly be
needed.</p>

<p>Now, as we are required to use every legitimate and practical method
of economy, it should at once occur to us that the plates must be
painted on both sides; indeed, this is such a common practice in cases
of this kind that it would readily occur to most solvers. We should
also remember that some of the figures may possibly be reversed to
form other figures; but as we were given a sketch of the actual shapes
of these figures when painted on the plates, it would be seen that
though the 6's may be turned upside down to make 9's, none of the
other figures can be so treated.</p>

<p>It will be found that in the case of the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,
thirty-three of each will be required in order to provide for every
possible emergency; in the case of 7, 8, and 0, we can only need
thirty of each; while in the case of the figure 6 (which may be
reversed for the figure 9) it is necessary to provide exactly
forty-two.</p>

<p>It is therefore clear that the total number of figures necessary is
297; but as the figures are painted on both sides of the plates, only
149 such plates are required. At first it would appear as if one of
the plates need only have a number on one side, the other side being
left blank. But here we come to a rather subtle point in the problem.</p>

<p>Readers may have remarked that in real life it is sometimes cheaper
when making a purchase to buy more articles than we require, on the
principle of a reduction on taking a quantity: we get more articles
and we pay less. Thus, if we want to buy ten apples, and the price
asked is a penny each if bought singly, or ninepence a dozen, we
should both save a penny and get two apples more than we wanted by
buying the full twelve. In the same way, since there is a regular
scale of reduction for plates painted alike, we actually save by
having two figures painted on that odd plate. Supposing, for example,
that we have thirty plates painted alike with 5 on one side and 6 on
the other. The rate would be 4¾<i>d</i>., and the cost 11<i>s</i>. 10½<i>d</i>. But
if the odd plate with, say, only a 5 on one side of it have a 6
painted on the other side, we get thirty-one plates at the reduced
rate of 4½<i>d</i>., thus saving a farthing on each of the previous
thirty, and reducing the cost of the last one from 1<i>s</i>. to 4½<i>d</i>.</p>

<p>But even after these points are all seen there comes in a new
difficulty: for although it will be found that all the 8's may be on
the backs of the 7's, we cannot have all the 2's on the backs of the
1's, nor all the 4 on the backs of the 3's, etc. There is a great
danger, in our attempts to get as many as possible painted alike, of
our so adjusting the figures that some particular combination of hymns
cannot be represented.</p>

<p>Here is the solution of the difficulty that was sent to the vicar of
Chumpley St. Winifred. Where the sign  is placed between two figures,
it implies that one of these figures is on one side of the plate and
the other on the other side.</p>

<p>Of course, if we could increase the number of plates, we might get the
painting done for nothing, but such a contingency is prevented by the
condition that the fewest possible plates must be provided.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 251<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a></span>This puzzle appeared in <i>Tit-Bits</i>, and the following remarks, made
by me in the issue for 11th December 1897, may be of interest.</p>

<p>The "Hymn-Board Poser" seems to have created extraordinary interest.
The immense number of attempts at its solution sent to me from all
parts of the United Kingdom and from several Continental countries
show a very kind disposition amongst our readers to help the worthy
vicar of Chumpley St. Winifred over his parochial difficulty. Every
conceivable estimate, from a few shillings up to as high a sum as
&pound;1,347, 10<i>s</i>., seems to have come to hand. But the astonishing part of
it is that, after going carefully through the tremendous pile of
correspondence, I find that only one competitor has succeeded in
maintaining the reputation of the <i>Tit-Bits</i> solvers for their
capacity to solve anything, and his solution is substantially the same
as the one given above, the cost being identical. Some of his figures
are differently combined, but his grouping of the plates, as shown in
the first column, is exactly the same. Though a large majority of
competitors clearly hit upon all the essential points of the puzzle,
they completely collapsed in the actual arrangement of the figures.
According to their methods, some possible selection of hymns, such as
111, 112, 121, 122,211, cannot be set up. A few correspondents
suggested that it might be possible so to paint the 7's that upside
down they would appear as 2's or 4's; but this would, of course, be
barred out by the fact that a representation of the actual figures to
be used was given.</p>

<p>The arithmetic of this puzzle is very easy indeed. There were clearly
24 pheasants at the start. Of these 16 were shot dead, 1 was wounded
in the wing, and 7 got away. The reader may have concluded that the
answer is, therefore, that "seven remained." But as they flew away it
is clearly absurd to say that they "remained." Had they done so they
would certainly have been killed. Must we then conclude that the 17
that were shot remained, because the others flew away? No; because the
question was not "how many remained?" but "how many still remained?"
Now the poor bird that was wounded in the wing, though unable to fly,
was very active in its painful struggles to run away. The answer is,
therefore, that the 16 birds that were shot dead "still remained," or
"remained still."</p>

<p>Nobody succeeded in solving the puzzle, so I had to let the cat out of
the bag&mdash;an operation that was dimly foreshadowed by the puss in the
original illustration. But I first reminded the reader that this
puzzle appeared on April 1, a day on which none of us ever resents
being made an "April Fool;" though, as I practically "gave the thing
away" by specially drawing attention to the fact that it was All
Fools' Day, it was quite remarkable that my correspondents, without a
single exception, fell into the trap.</p>

<p>One large body of correspondents held that what the cook loses in
stride is exactly made up in greater speed; consequently both advance
at the same rate, and the result must be a tie. But another
considerable section saw that, though this might be so in a race 200
ft. straight away, it could not really be, because they each go a
stated distance at "every bound," and as 100 is not an exact multiple
of 3, the gardener at his thirty-fourth bound will go 2 ft. beyond the
mark. The gardener will, therefore, run to a point 102 ft. straight
away and return (204 ft. in all), and so lose by 4 ft. This point
certainly comes into the puzzle. But the most important fact of all is
this, that it so happens that the gardener was a pupil from the
Horticultural College for Lady Gardeners at, if I remember aright,
Swanley; while the cook was a very accomplished French chef of the
hemale persuasion! Therefore "she (the gardener) made three bounds to
his (the cook's) two." It will now be found that while the gardener is
running her 204 ft. in 68 bounds of 3 ft., the somewhat infirm old
cook can only make 45<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of his 2 ft. bounds, which equals 90 ft. 8
in. The result is that the lady gardener wins the race by 109 ft. 4
in. at a moment when the cook is in the air, one-third through his
46th bound.</p>

<p>The moral of this puzzle is twofold: (1) Never take things for granted
in attempting to solve puzzles; (2) always remember All Fools' Day
when it comes round. I was not writing of <i>any</i> gardener and cook, but
of a <i>particular</i> couple, in "a race that I witnessed." The statement
of the eye-witness must therefore be accepted: as the reader was not
there, he cannot contradict it. Of course the information supplied was
insufficient, but the correct reply was: "Assuming the gardener to be
the 'he,' the cook wins by 4 ft.; but if the gardener is the 'she,'
then the gardener wins by 109 ft. 4 in." This would have won the
prize. Curiously enough, one solitary competitor got on to the right
track, but failed to follow it up. He said: "Is this a regular April 1
catch, meaning that they only ran 6 ft. each, and consequently the
race was unfinished? If not, I think the following must be the
solution, supposing the gardener to be the 'he' and the cook the
'she.'" Though his solution was wrong even in the case he supposed,
yet he was the only person who suspected the question of sex.</p>

<p>There is no guessing required in this puzzle. It is all a question of
elimination. If we can pair off any five of the ladies with their
respective husbands, other than husband No. 10, then the remaining
lady must be No. 10's wife.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>Pg 252<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a></span></p>

<p>I will show how this may be done. No. 8 is seen carrying a lady's
parasol in the same hand with his walking-stick. But every lady is
provided with a parasol, except No. 3; therefore No. 3 may be safely
said to be the wife of No. 8. Then No. 12 is holding a bicycle, and
the dress-guard and make disclose the fact that it is a lady's
bicycle. The only lady in a cycling skirt is No. 5; therefore we
conclude that No. 5 is No. 12's wife. Next, the man No. 6 has a dog,
and lady No. 11 is seen carrying a dog chain. So we may safely pair
No. 6 with No. 11. Then we see that man No. 2 is paying a newsboy for
a paper. But we do not pay for newspapers in this way before receiving
them, and the gentleman has apparently not taken one from the boy. But
lady No. 9 is seen reading a paper. The inference is obvious&mdash;that she
has sent the boy to her husband for a penny. We therefore pair No. 2
with No. 9. We have now disposed of all the ladies except Nos. 1 and
7, and of all the men except Nos. 4 and 10. On looking at No. 4 we
find that he is carrying a coat over his arm, and that the buttons are
on the left side;&mdash;not on the right, as a man wears them. So it is a
lady's coat. But the coat clearly does not belong to No. 1, as she is
seen to be wearing a coat already, while No. 7 lady is very lightly
clad. We therefore pair No. 7 lady with man No. 4. Now the only lady
left is No. 1, and we are consequently forced to the conclusion that
she is the wife of No. 10. This is therefore the correct answer.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
